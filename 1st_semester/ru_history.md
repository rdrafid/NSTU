The Question:"What grounds did Alexander Block have to write the following expression? What is the true origin of the Russians?"
The Provided Text:
The text is an excerpt from the poem "The Scythians" (Скифы) written by Alexander Blok in 1918.
* Russian Excerpt: The provided Cyrillic text contains several errors (e.g., "ягодыни охлани" is a severe distortion of the correct line "жадными очами"). The correct final two lines are: "Да, скифы — мы! Да, азиаты — мы, / С раскосыми и жадными очами!"* English Translation: The provided English translation is interpretive and takes significant liberties. A more standard, literal translation is: "Yes, we are Scythians! Yes, we are Asiatics, / With slanted and greedy eyes!"

Answer and Explanation:

1. Alexander Blok's "Grounds" (Historical & Ideological Context):
   * The Poem's Moment: Blok wrote "The Scythians" in January 1918, immediately after the Bolsheviks dissolved the Russian Constituent Assembly. This was a moment of immense turmoil, with World War I ongoing and the Russian Civil War beginning. The poem is addressed to the "Old World" of Europe.
   * The "Scythian" Myth: Blok is using a powerful historical metaphor. The Scythians were ancient nomadic tribes of the Eurasian steppes, often portrayed in classical Greek history as the archetypal "barbarian" other—fierce, uncivilized, and a constant threat to the settled, "civilized" West.
   * Blok's Message: Blok identifies revolutionary Russia with these Scythians. His "grounds" are not genetic or anthropological but cultural-political and metaphysical. He is arguing that Russia represents a primordial, elemental, and "Asiatic" force that Europe has always feared and misunderstood. The poem is both a warning to Europe not to interfere in the Russian Revolution and a declaration of Russia's unique, non-European identity. It taps into a long-standing Russian intellectual debate between "Westernizers" and "Slavophiles," positioning Russia as a distinct Eurasian civilization.
2. The "True Origin" of the Russians (Fact-Checking & Modern Science):
   * Clarifying the Question: The exam question seems to conflate Blok's metaphorical use of "Scythians" with a literal ethnic origin. This is a common misconception that the question itself might be prompting the student to correct.
   * Historical Facts:
      * Scythians: They were predominantly an Iranian-speaking confederation of nomadic tribes dominant in the Pontic-Caspian steppe from approximately the 7th century BC to the 3rd century AD. They were largely assimilated or displaced by later migrations, including the Sarmatians, Goths, and Huns.
      * Slavs (the ancestors of Russians): The early Slavs emerged as a distinct linguistic and cultural group in Central/Eastern Europe much later, around the 5th-6th centuries AD. Their homeland is debated but was likely north of the Carpathian Mountains, in regions like present-day Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus—areas that were, centuries earlier, on the periphery of Scythian influence.
   * Genetic & Archaeological Consensus: There is no direct lineal descent of the Russian people from the Scythians. The ethnogenesis of the Russians is primarily from:
      * Early East Slavic tribes (like the Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs, Vyatichs).
      * Assimilation of Finno-Ugric tribes (indigenous populations of the North Russian forests).
      * A significant Scandinavian (Varangian) element among the ruling elite in the early Kyivan Rus' state (9th-11th centuries).
      * Later influences from Turkic, Baltic, and other groups.
Conclusion to Question #2: Alexander Blok's grounds were poetic and ideological, using the Scythian metaphor to express Russia's revolutionary, anti-Western, and Eurasian identity in 1918. Scientifically, the "true origin" of the Russians is not from the Scythians, but primarily from the later East Slavic tribes, with significant Finno-Ugric and Scandinavian components.

The Question:

"These two pictures illustrate the same legend about the origin of the Russian state. What caused furious disputes about the legend? What is the scientific reply to the question disputed?"

Inference from Context:

Since the pictures are not visible but are described as illustrating a legend about the origin of the Russian state, the legend is almost certainly the "Calling of the Varangians" (or the Normanist theory).

* The Legend: As recorded in the Russian Primary Chronicle (12th century), the Slavic and Finnic tribes of the Novgorod region, mired in internecine conflict, invited the Varangian (Scandinavian) chieftain Rurik and his brothers to rule over them in 862. Rurik established himself in Novgorod, founding the Rurikid dynasty, which ruled Kyivan Rus' and later Muscovy/Russia for over 700 years.

Detailed Answer

The Legend: The two pictures illustrate the foundational legend of the Russian state as recorded in the "Tale of Bygone Years" (The Russian Primary Chronicle), compiled in the 12th century. The legend is known as "The Calling of the Varangians" or the "Invitation to Rurik."

According to the Chronicle, in the year 862, the various Slavic (Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs) and Finno-Ugric (Chud, Ves, etc.) tribes in the region of Novgorod, tired of internal conflict and lacking order, decided to seek a ruler from abroad. They are quoted as saying, "Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us." They invited the Varangian (Scandinavian) chieftain Rurik and his brothers, Sineus and Truvor. Rurik settled in Novgorod (or Ladoga), founding the Rurikid Dynasty, which ruled Kievan Rus' and its successor states (including Muscovy and early Tsardom of Russia) until 1598.

1. What Caused the Furious Disputes About the Legend?

The disputes form the core of the "Normanist Question" (Normanist vs. Anti-Normanist Debate), which has been one of the most heated and politicized debates in Russian historiography for nearly 300 years. The fury stems from its implications for Russian national identity, origins, and political ideology.

* The Normanist Position (Origins in 18th Century German Historians): This view accepts the basic validity of the chronicle's account. It argues that the Scandinavians (Vikings/Varangians) were the decisive, organizing force in the creation of the first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus'. They point to:
   * The name "Rus" itself, which they derive from the Old Norse term "róðr" (a crew of oarsmen) or from "Ruotsi," the Finnish name for Sweden.
   * Archaeological evidence of significant Scandinavian presence in key trade centers like Staraya Ladoga, Novgorod, and Gnezdovo (near Smolensk) in the 9th-10th centuries.
   * The names of the first Rus' princes and ambassadors in Byzantine treaties, which are overwhelmingly Norse (e.g., Oleg = Helgi, Olga = Helga, Igor = Ingvar).
   * The testimony of contemporary foreign sources (Byzantine, Arab) that distinguish the "Rus" as a group separate from the Slavs.
* The Anti-Normanist Position (A Reaction with Nationalist & Political Dimensions): This view rejects the Chronicle's account as a later fabrication or misinterpretation. It argues that the Slavic state was an entirely indigenous development, and the Varangian role was minimal, mercenary, or mythical. The "furious" nature of the dispute arises because:
   * National Pride: The idea that the Russian state was founded by "foreigners" (Germans/Scandinavians) was seen as an insult to national dignity, especially from the 19th century onward as Romantic nationalism grew.
   * Soviet Ideology: Under Stalin, the Normanist theory was officially condemned as "bourgeois falsification" that denied the Slavic peoples' capacity for independent state formation—a key tenet of Marxist historical materialism. Anti-Normanism became state doctrine, and archaeologists/historians who argued for a significant Norse role faced severe persecution.
   * Modern Politics: The debate continues to resonate, with some modern Russian nationalists and "patriotic" historians strongly promoting Anti-Normanist views, seeing the Normanist theory as a Western plot to diminish Russia's historical stature.

In essence, the dispute is furious because it is not just an academic quarrel about archaeology, but a battle over the founding myth of the Russian nation: Was it created from within by the Slavic people, or catalyzed from without by Viking outsiders?

2. What is the Scientific Reply to the Question Disputed?

Modern scholarship, based on decades of interdisciplinary research (archaeology, linguistics, numismatics, comparative chronicle study), has moved beyond the rigid "either/or" dichotomy to a nuanced synthetic consensus. The scientific reply deconstructs the legend and provides a complex, evidence-based picture.

1. The Legend as Foundational Myth: Scholars agree the Chronicle story is a mythologized, later construction (written 300 years after the events) designed to:

* Give the ruling Rurikid dynasty a legitimate and prestigious foreign origin.
* Explain the name "Rus."
* Portray the founding of the state as a peaceful, legal contract, not a conquest.

2. The Consensus on Historical Reality:

* Indigenous Development: The region was not empty. Complex tribal societies of Slavs, Balts, and Finno-Ugric peoples existed, with their own social stratification, trade, and proto-urban centers (like the gorodishche near future Novgorod).
* The Crucial Role of Trade: The Volkhov-Dnieper river system ("The Route from the Varangians to the Greeks") was the economic engine. Control of this trade in furs, slaves, silver, and luxury goods generated the wealth and inter-tribal connections necessary for state formation.
* The Varangians as Catalyst and Elite: Here is the key synthesis: Scandinavian Vikings (Varangians) were not the "creators" of the Slavic people or their culture, but they became the dominant military-commercial elite that unified the pre-existing tribal structures under a new political framework. They were the armed traders and warriors who mastered the long-distance routes, established key fortified trading posts (emporia), and eventually took political control of them.
* The "Invitation" Trope: The concept of "inviting a ruler" is a common medieval literary trope to legitimize power. In reality, the process likely involved a combination of trade, mercenary service, conflict, and gradual assumption of power by a successful Varangian warlord (like the historical Rurik) and his retinue (druzhina).
* Rapid Assimilation: Critically, the Scandinavian elite was small. Within a generation or two, they had completely assimilated into the local Slavic majority, adopting their language, customs, and identity. By the time of Vladimir the Great (late 10th century), the rulers were culturally Slavic Orthodox princes, not Norse pagans.

Final Scientific Reply: The furious dispute is based on a false dichotomy. The modern scientific view holds that the origin of the Russian state was a complex process of internal socio-economic development among the Eastern Slavs, which was critically accelerated, unified, and politically led by a Scandinavian warrior-trading elite. The state of Kievan Rus' was born from the synergy between the Slavic-Finnic substrate and the Varangian superstrate. The legend of Rurik's calling preserves a kernel of truth about the foreign origin of its first dynasty, but not about the origin of the Russian people themselves.

Of course. Based on the provided screenshot, here are detailed explanations and answers for Questions 4 and 5. The facts have been cross-referenced with established historical scholarship.

The Image & The Scene:

The medieval-style illustration depicts Princess Olga of Kiev (c. 920–969), the ruler of Kievan Rus'. The specific scene illustrated is a famous episode from the Primary Chronicle describing her bloody revenge against the Drevlians, the tribe that killed her husband, Prince Igor.
"Why is the woman on the right taking a bath in the presence of the two men?"
Short Answer: She is not taking a bath. It is a trap, and she is having them burned alive.

Detailed Context: After executing several initial acts of revenge on the Drevlians, Olga promised to forgive them and asked for a show of honor. The Drevlians sent their best men to escort her. The chronicle then states: "Olga commanded that a bath be prepared for them, inviting them to wash after their long journey. When the men entered the bathhouse, Olga had it set on fire, and they were all burned to death." The illustration you see captures the moment the Drevlians enter the bathhouse before it is sealed and ignited. The two men are Drevlian ambassadors/nobles, and Olga is overseeing the execution of her elaborate scheme.

1."What differed her as a ruler from the preceding Russian dukes (princes)?"

Princess Olga is a monumental figure who differed from her predecessors (like Oleg, Igor, and her own husband) in two fundamental ways:
1. She was the first major female ruler. She ruled as regent for her young son, Sviatoslav, but exercised power with exceptional skill and authority, securing the state during a vulnerable transition.
2. She was the first Christian ruler of Kievan Rus' and a key civilizing reformer. While her predecessors were pagan warriors focused on conquest and tribute, Olga instituted a systematic, peaceful administration.

Administrative Reforms: She established a system of "pogosts" (administrative and trading centers) and standardized tribute collection, moving away from the chaotic, violent "poludie" (tribute-gathering tours) that got her husband killed.
Religious Significance: Baptized in Constantinople (c. 957), she became the first Christian in the Rus' ruling dynasty. Although she failed to convert her pagan son, her baptism planted the seed for the official Christianization of Rus' under her grandson, Vladimir the Great, in 988. For this, she is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church (Equal-to-the-Apostles).

Summary: She transitioned the ruler's role from a pagan warlord ("knyaz") to a Christian monarch focused on state-building, law, and diplomacy with the Byzantine Empire.

The Image & The City:
The reconstructed red-brick and wood fortress is part of the Kievan Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves) or the general fortifications of Kiev (Kyiv), the capital of modern Ukraine. The question confirms the city is Kiev.
"How did it happen that this city became the 'mother to the Russian cities'..."
The phrase "mother of Russian cities" is a direct translation from the Old East Slavic chronicles ("матерь городам русским"). Kiev earned this title because:
Political Capital: Under Prince Oleg (who moved there from Novgorod around 882), it became the capital of the Rurikid dynasty and the unified state of Kievan Rus'.
Religious & Cultural Center: After the Baptism of Rus' in 988 under Vladimir the Great, Kiev became the seat of the Metropolitan (the head of the Orthodox Church in the region). The magnificent Cathedral of Holy Wisdom (St. Sophia) and the Kiev Pechersk Lavra became centers of liturgy, art, literature, and law (e.g., Russkaya Pravda).
Source of Identity: For centuries, "Rus'" referred primarily to the land around Kiev. The shared Christian faith, dynastic rule, and culture that emanated from Kiev provided the foundational identity for the East Slavic peoples (the ancestors of modern Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians).
"...and how it found itself beyond the Russian borders?"
This refers to Kiev not being part of the modern state of the Russian Federation.

Historical Process:
Decline & Fragmentation (12th-13th centuries): After the death of Vladimir Monomakh, Kievan Rus' fragmented into rival principalities. The political and economic center began shifting north-east to Vladimir-Suzdal and later Moscow.
Mongol Destruction (1240): The Mongol invasion under Batu Khan sacked and devastated Kiev, breaking its power permanently.
Divergent Paths: The historical lands of Rus' developed under different dominions:
The north-east (including Moscow) evolved into the Tsardom of Russia.
The south-west (including Kiev) came under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Modern Borders: Kiev remained a central city for the Ukrainian people. After periods of Cossack autonomy and rule by the Russian Empire, the modern state of Ukraine was formed in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Kiev became the capital of the independent nation of Ukraine, thus placing it "beyond the borders" of the Russian Federation.

Conclusion: Kiev became the "mother of Russian cities" as the first political, religious, and cultural capital of the medieval East Slavic civilization, Kievan Rus'. It now lies outside Russia's borders due to the medieval fragmentation of that civilization, centuries of separate political development under Lithuanian/Polish rule, and the establishment of the modern independent state of Ukraine in the late 20th century.

The Subject:The monuments shown are dedicated to Yaroslav I, known as Yaroslav the Wise (Ярослав Мудрый) (c. 978–1054), Grand Prince of Kiev.

Answer and Explanation:

1. Why the Monuments are in These Specific Cities:
   * Kiev: As the capital, it was the seat of Yaroslav's power. His reign is considered the golden age of Kievan Rus'. The most famous monument to him stands near the Golden Gate, and his greatest architectural achievement, the Cathedral of Saint Sophia, is a UNESCO World Heritage site built under his rule.
   * Novgorod: Before ruling in Kiev, Yaroslav was the Prince of Novgorod. It was from here that he launched the campaign to claim the Kievan throne from his brother. He granted the city a degree of self-governance and a charter of laws, which strengthened its importance. A monument to him is part of the city's historical landscape.
   * Yaroslavl: This city is named after him. According to legend, he founded the city on the Volga River. Monuments to its founder are, therefore, central to the city's identity.
2. His Role in Russian History:Yaroslav the Wise was one of the most important rulers of Kievan Rus'. His role was transformative:
   * Consolidator of the State: He defeated his rivals and reunited the core lands of Rus', ending a period of fratricidal war. His long reign (1019–1054) brought internal stability.
   * Lawgiver: He oversaw the creation and codification of the first written Slavic law code, the "Russkaya Pravda" (Русская Правда, "Justice of Rus'"). This laid the legal foundation for the state for centuries.
   * Builder and Patron of Culture: He transformed Kiev into a major European capital, building the Saint Sophia Cathedral (rivaling Constantinople's Hagia Sophia), the Golden Gate, and monasteries. His court became a center for chronicle-writing, translation of Greek texts, and education.
   * International Statesman: He created a web of dynastic marriages linking Rus' to the royal houses of Europe (France, Hungary, Norway) and the Byzantine Empire, elevating Rus' to a major European power.

Conclusion for Q6: The monuments honor Yaroslav the Wise, the ruler who solidified Kievan Rus' as a stable, law-governed, Christian European power and a major center of culture and architecture.

# 7
The Subject:The text and monuments refer to Vladimir II Monomakh (Владимир Мономах) (1053–1125), Grand Prince of Kiev.

Answer and Explanation:

1. Identifying the Author from the Text:The provided text is a direct excerpt from Monomakh's most famous work, "The Instruction (or Testament) to My Children" (Поучение детям). It is a unique piece of medieval literature—part autobiography, part moral guide, and part political memoir written by a ruling prince for his sons.
   * The text describes a specific historical event: his conflict with Prince Oleg of Chernigov (his cousin) in 1076, where Monomakh chose to cede Chernigov to avoid further bloodshed among Christian Slavs, retreating to the smaller town of Pereslavl. His reflection, "I took pity on the souls of our Christian subjects...", is a hallmark of his writing, emphasizing piety, responsibility, and the avoidance of fratricidal strife.
2. His Role in Russian History:Vladimir Monomakh played a critical role during the beginning of Rus' fragmentation.
   * Last Unifier: He became Grand Prince of Kiev in 1113, not by the usual order of succession, but by popular acclaim of the Kievans to quell a rebellion. He was the last ruler to exercise substantial authority over the increasingly divided and rivalrous principalities of Kievan Rus'.
   * Lawmaker: He added new articles to the "Russkaya Pravda," regulating debts and the status of commoners, showing concern for social order.
   * Military Leader and Diplomat: He is most famous for organizing and leading a series of successful united campaigns against the Cumans (Polovtsians), the nomadic steppe people who constantly raided Rus' lands. His "Instruction" contains vivid accounts of these campaigns. He also used dynastic marriages to secure Rus' borders.
   * Cultural Figure: His "Instruction" is a priceless historical document and literary masterpiece, offering a rare personal voice from the period on rulership, faith, and ethics. It solidified his image as the ideal Christian prince—brave, pious, and wise.
3. The Monuments:The two statues (a bust and a seated figure) are common representations of Monomakh. He is often depicted as a thoughtful, bearded ruler, sometimes holding a cross or a scroll (symbolizing his "Instruction" or the law). Such monuments to him can be found in cities like Moscow (where he is considered a symbolic predecessor of the Muscovite tsars) and Chernigov.
Conclusion: The person is Vladimir Monomakh. His role was that of the last effective ruler of a united Kievan Rus', a famed military leader against the steppe nomads, a lawgiver, and the author of a seminal literary work that defined the ideals of princely rule in Russian culture.

# 8

The Region and the City:

* Region: The region indicated on the map is the North-East of Kievan Rus', specifically the interfluve of the Oka and Volga rivers. This area was the core of the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality.
* The City: The new city to which the center of power moved was Vladimir-on-Klyazma (Vladimir). While founded earlier, it became the political capital in the 12th century under Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky.

Explanation of the Shift in Power and Vladimir's Rise:

The shift of the political center from Kiev to Vladimir in the 12th century was caused by a combination of Kiev's decline and the North-East's strategic advantages.

1. Decline of Kiev (The "Push" Factors):

* Fragmentation & Dynastic Strife: The Kievan Rus' state fragmented into competing principalities after the reign of Vladimir Monomakh. Kiev was constantly fought over by rival branches of the Rurikid dynasty, weakening it through endless princely wars.
* Economic Decline: The Byzantine Empire's decline and the shifting of major Eurasian trade routes (like the Silk Road) away from the Dnieper River undermined Kiev's economic foundation.
* Nomadic Pressure: Constant raids by the Cumans (Polovtsians) on the southern steppe frontiers made the Kiev region increasingly dangerous and unstable, disrupting agriculture and trade.

2. Rise of Vladimir-Suzdal (The "Pull" Factors):

* Strategic Security: The North-East was protected by dense forests ("Zalessky Krai" - "Land beyond the forests"), which acted as a natural buffer against nomadic cavalry raids from the steppe.
* Economic Potential: It featured vast expanses of fertile land ("Opolye"), attracting settlers from the war-torn south. It had abundant resources (timber, furs) and controlled the headwaters of the Volga River trade route.
* Strong, Centralized Rule: Princes like Yuri Dolgoruky and especially his son Andrei Bogolyubsky pursued a policy of strengthening their personal, autocratic power, breaking the tradition of seniority and boyar (noble) councils that hampered Kiev. Andrei explicitly spurned Kiev, sacking it in 1169 and taking the title of Grand Prince to his own capital, Vladimir.
* Symbolic Legitimacy: To legitimize Vladimir as the new capital, Andrei and his successors embarked on a monumental building program. They constructed magnificent white-stone cathedrals (e.g., the Dormition Cathedral) and Golden Gates, rivaling and intended to surpass Kiev's splendor. They also promoted the veneration of a new national icon, the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God.

Conclusion for Q8: The center of power moved from Kiev to Vladimir in the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality because the North-East offered security, economic potential, and the opportunity for its princes to build a new, more centralized state, free from the internecine strife and external vulnerabilities that plagued Kiev.

# 9

The Two External Dangers of the Early 13th Century:

In the early 13th century, the Russian principalities faced a catastrophic existential threat from the East and a severe ideological-military threat from the North-West.

1. The Mongol Invasion (The Tatar-Mongol Yoke):
   * Who: The unified Mongol Empire under Batu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan.
   * When: The main invasion of the Rus' principalities occurred from 1237 to 1240.
   * Nature of the Danger: This was a war of conquest and subjugation. The Mongols employed total warfare, systematically destroying cities (like Ryazan, Vladimir, and Kiev), massacring populations, and dismantling existing political structures. Their goal was to make the Russian princes tributary vassals.
2. The Northern Crusades (Swedish and German Knights):
   * Who: Swedish forces and the German Teutonic Order and Order of the Sword Brothers (later merged as the Livonian Order).
   * When: A sustained campaign throughout the 13th century, with critical battles in the 1240s.
   * Nature of the Danger: This was a religious-political expansion. The Swedish and German orders, under the banner of the Papacy's Northern Crusades, sought to conquer and convert the Orthodox and pagan lands of Novgorod and Pskov. The danger was not just territorial loss but the enforced conversion of the population from Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism, threatening the core of Russian cultural identity.

How Russia Dealt with Them:

The response to these twin threats diverged dramatically, setting a historical course for centuries.

1. Response to the Mongols: Pragmatic Submission and Survival.
   * Military Resistance & Defeat: Initial resistance by individual principalities (like Vladimir) was heroic but futile. The Russian armies were defeated in detail due to a lack of unity and the Mongols' superior military tactics.
   * Acceptance of Vassalage: After the destruction, the surviving Russian princes, beginning with Yaroslav II of Vladimir in 1243, were forced to travel to the Mongol capital Sarai to receive a patent for rule ("yarlyk"). This meant acknowledging the Khan of the Golden Horde as their sovereign, paying heavy tribute (including a tax on individuals), and supplying troops.
   * Result: This established the "Tatar Yoke," a period of over 200 years of Mongol suzerainty. The Russian principalities retained their internal order and Orthodox faith but lost their sovereignty and were bled dry by tribute. This subjugation, while humiliating, allowed Russian statehood and culture to survive.
2. Response to the Western Crusaders: Military Defense and Symbolic Victory.
   * Unified Military Action: The Republic of Novgorod, which was largely spared by the Mongols due to its northern swampy lands, took the lead. It called upon its prince, Alexander Yaroslavich.
   * Alexander Nevsky's Campaigns: Prince Alexander decisively defeated the two invading forces:
      * Battle of the Neva (1240): He defeated a Swedish army, earning the epithet "Nevsky" ("of the Neva").
      * Battle on the Ice (Lake Peipus, 1242): He famously defeated the heavily armored knights of the Teutonic Order on the frozen lake, halting their eastward advance.
   * Result & Strategy: These victories stopped the Catholic German and Swedish expansion into Russian lands. Alexander Nevsky chose a policy of peaceful submission to the Mongols (seeing them as less of a threat to Russian identity, as they did not interfere with the Orthodox Church) in order to focus all resources on defending the western frontier. This policy was endorsed by the Orthodox Church and became foundational for future Muscovite strategy.

Conclusion for Q9: Russia faced annihilation from the Mongol Empire and conquest/conversion from the Western Crusaders. It dealt with the Mongols through pragmatic submission and vassalage to ensure survival, and with the Western threat through decisive military resistance led by Alexander Nevsky. This dual response preserved Orthodoxy and the Russian principalities, albeit under the long and oppressive Mongol Yoke.

Here are detailed, fact-checked answers for Questions 10 and 11, based on the provided descriptions.

# 10

The Name of the Russian Duke:

The duke depicted in both pictures is Alexander Yaroslavich, known as Alexander Nevsky (Александр Невский) (c. 1221–1263), Prince of Novgorod, Grand Prince of Kiev and Vladimir.

Explanation of the Pictures' Plots:

1. Left Picture (The Warrior on Horseback): This depicts Alexander Nevsky as a military commander and saint. The scene almost certainly represents his most famous victory: the Battle on the Ice (Ледовое побоище) on Lake Peipus in 1242, where he decisively defeated the crusading knights of the Teutonic Order. Alternatively, it could symbolize his earlier victory over the Swedes at the Battle of the Neva (1240), from which he earned the epithet "Nevsky" ("of the Neva"). The imagery emphasizes his role as the defender of the Russian lands from Western invaders.
2. Right Picture (The Ruler on the Throne): This depicts Alexander Nevsky as a statesman and loyal vassal. The scene likely shows him paying homage to or receiving a yarlyk (a patent to rule) from a Mongol Khan of the Golden Horde. After the Mongol conquest, Russian princes had to travel to the Horde's capital, Sarai, to pledge allegiance and be confirmed in their principalities. This image illustrates the other, more controversial pillar of Alexander's policy: pragmatic submission to the Mongol Empire to secure peace for his people and his own political authority.

Why was he advertised by Soviet propaganda in the late 1930s?

Soviet propaganda under Joseph Stalin resurrected and radically reshaped Alexander Nevsky's image in 1938 for specific, urgent political reasons tied to the pre-WWII climate:

1. Patriotic Mobilization: With the rising threat of Nazi Germany, Stalin needed a national Russian hero to rally the people, bypassing Communist internationalist ideology. Alexander Nevsky, as a legendary defender of the Motherland against foreign invaders, was perfect.
2. Anti-German Symbolism: The 1938 Sergei Eisenstein film Alexander Nevsky, with its iconic score by Prokofiev, was the centerpiece of this campaign. The film graphically depicted the Teutonic Knights as ruthless, fanatical invaders, creating a direct and powerful historical parallel to the contemporary Nazi threat. The film's famous quote, "Whoever comes to us with a sword, shall die by the sword," was a clear message to Germany.
3. Strategic Message: The propaganda highlighted only one side of his legacy—the defiant resistance to the West. It completely omitted his subservience to the Mongols. The message was clear: Russia must unite and fiercely resist the invasion from the West (Germany), while the government could pursue pragmatic diplomacy with the East (the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact of 1941 echoed this). His canonization by the Orthodox Church was downplayed, secularizing him into a purely national hero.

In summary: The pictures show Alexander Nevsky as both the defender against the West and the pragmatic vassal of the East. Soviet propaganda in the late 1930s exalted the first role to forge a nationalist, anti-German rallying point on the eve of World War II.

The City Marked by the Red Dot:

Based on the map's context ("Principality of Moscow" is labeled) and the historical question, the red dot almost certainly marks Moscow (Москва).

1. Its Name in the Early 13th Century:

In the early 13th century (specifically, at the time of the first written mention and before the Mongol invasion), it was a small fortified town on the Moskva River called Moscow. Its first mention in a chronicle is dated to 1147, when Prince Yuri Dolgoruky of Vladimir-Suzdal is said to have feasted there. There was no other name; it was simply the settlement of Moscow.

2. How it Became the Most Important Russian City by the End of the 13th Century:

Moscow's rise from a minor provincial outpost to the preeminent Russian city by 1300 was dramatic and resulted from a combination of shrewd politics, geography, and Mongol policy.

* Strategic Geography: Moscow was excellently located:
   * At the crossroads of important river trade routes (Moskva River connected the Volga and Oka basins).
   * In the relatively forested center of the Vladimir-Suzdal lands, offering protection from Mongol raids compared to more exposed cities like Vladimir or Kiev.
   * This attracted merchants, artisans, and peasants seeking safety, boosting its population and wealth.
* Shrewd, Long-Reigning Princes: The early princes of Moscow were ambitious and politically astute.
   * Daniel (1261-1303), the founder of the Moscow princely line and youngest son of Alexander Nevsky, is credited with initiating Moscow's expansion, seizing the key town of Kolomna.
   * The princes played the role of loyal, dependable servants to the Mongol Khans of the Golden Horde. They meticulously collected and delivered tribute, often using Mongol authority to undermine rival princes.
* The Key Factor: Mongol Patronage: This was the most critical element. The Mongols (Golden Horde) needed a reliable local ruler to act as their chief tax collector and enforcer among the Russian princes. The princes of Moscow proved ruthlessly efficient at this.
   * In 1328, Prince Ivan I (Ivan Kalita, "Moneybags") helped the Mongols crush a rebellion in Tver, Moscow's main rival. As a reward, the Mongol Khan granted him the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir and the exclusive right to collect tribute for the Horde from all Russian lands.
   * This made Moscow the de facto administrative and financial capital of Rus'. Ivan Kalita used the vast wealth from collected tribute to buy lands, loan money to other princes, and fortify Moscow with the first stone Kremlin (1339). He also persuaded the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Metropolitan, to move his seat from Vladimir to Moscow (c. 1326), making it the religious capital as well.

Conclusion for Q11: The city is Moscow. From a minor fort mentioned in 1147, it rose to supremacy by 1300 and solidified its status by 1340 due to its strategic location, the cunning and loyal service of its princes to the Mongol overlords, and the resulting roles as the primary tax collector for the Horde and, subsequently, the religious and political center of the Russian lands. Its rise was fundamentally tied to its subservient but exploitative relationship with the Mongol Empire.
Based on the screenshot you provided, here are detailed answers for Questions 12 and 13, continuing the format of thorough explanation and fact-checking.

The Episode Depicted:

The religious-style illustration depicts a church service, likely a liturgy or a prayer for divine intercession. The key detail indicated by the red circles is the specific gesture of blessing being used by the priest or bishop, and the focused, solemn atmosphere. Given the historical context of the questions in this exam (which have progressed through the 13th-14th centuries), this most likely represents a specific, famous moment: St. Sergius of Radonezh blessing Prince Dmitry Donskoy and his army before the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380.

Historical Significance of the Epoch:

This event belongs to the period of the "Moscow's Rise" and the initial, successful challenges to Mongol-Tatar authority in the late 14th century.

* The Event's Significance: Before facing the mighty army of the Golden Horde at Kulikovo Field, Prince Dmitry of Moscow sought the blessing of St. Sergius, the highly respected spiritual leader and founder of the Trinity Lavra monastery. St. Sergius not only blessed him but also predicted his victory, saying, "Go forth without fear, you will prevail." This blessing was crucial, as it framed the upcoming battle not merely as a political rebellion, but as a holy war for the Orthodox faith and the Russian land.
* The Epoch's Significance: This period (late 14th century) is defined by:
   1. The Weakening of the Golden Horde: It was experiencing internal strife (the "Great Troubles").
   2. The Consolidation of Moscow's Leadership: Moscow had grown strong enough under princes like Dmitry Donskoy to openly challenge its Mongol overlords for the first time.
   3. The Birth of National Consciousness: The struggle transformed from passive submission to an active, united military and spiritual resistance, with Moscow and the Russian Orthodox Church acting as the unifying forces. The blessing symbolizes this powerful church-state alliance that became central to Russian identity.

In summary: The image captures the spiritual preparation for the first major Russian victory over the Mongols. The epoch signifies the end of passive submission and the beginning of a conscious, unified struggle for independence, led by Moscow and blessed by the Church.

The Successful Episodes Against the Mongols Depicted:

The battle illustration shows Russian soldiers fighting steppe warriors. The two most significant, successful military episodes of the Russian struggle against the Golden Horde in this era are:

1. The Battle of Kulikovo Field (1380): Led by Prince Dmitry of Moscow (later "Donskoy")**, a coalition of Russian principalities inflicted a severe defeat on the forces of the Mongol warlord Mamai. This was the first major pitched battle where a Russian army defeated a Horde force of comparable size. It was a catastrophic defeat for Mamai, who was soon overthrown.
2. The Standoff at the Ugra River (1480): While not a bloody battle, this was a decisive strategic and political victory. The armies of Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscow and the army of Khan Ahmed of the Great Horde faced each other across the river for weeks. The Mongols eventually retreated without engaging in a major battle. This event is traditionally considered the end of the "Tatar Yoke," as Moscow formally ceased paying tribute and declared its full sovereignty.

Significance of the Epoch:

These events belong to the final stage of the "Moscow's Gathering of the Russian Lands" and the process of throwing off the Mongol Yoke (c. 1380-1480). This century-long epoch is one of the most critical in Russian history.

* Military-Political Significance: It marked the complete reversal of power dynamics. From being a submissive vassal, Moscow grew to become the independent, dominant power in the region. The victories proved the Horde was not invincible and that a unified Russian force could prevail.
* Psychological and National Significance: Kulikovo, in particular, was a massive psychological breakthrough. It gave the Russian principalities a sense of their own strength and a shared heroic narrative. It solidified Moscow's role as the defender of Rus' and the rightful center of the struggle for independence.
* State-Building Significance: The process culminated in 1480 with Ivan III's stand at the Ugra, which finalized Moscow's sovereignty. Freed from the tribute burden and with the prestige of being the "liberator," the Grand Principality of Moscow transformed into a sovereign, centralized Russian state, setting the stage for its declaration as a Tsardom in 1547.

In summary: The images represent the key victories at Kulikovo (1380) and/or the Ugra (1480). Their epoch signifies the century-long, successful struggle for independence from the Mongol Empire, which fundamentally created the conditions for the birth of the sovereign, centralized Russian state under Moscow's leadership.

Thank you for providing the detailed context from the image. Here are the comprehensive, fact-checked answers for Questions 14 and 15.

# 14

1. The Event Shown in the Pictures:

Based on the description of a "colorful" old town scene and a "black-and-white" crowd scene, and the logical progression of the exam (which has just covered the end of Mongol rule, c. 1480), the most likely event depicted is the end of the Time of Troubles (Смутное Время) and the election of Mikhail Romanov to the throne in 1613.

* The Colorful Image (ancient town scene): This likely depicts the Kremlin and Cathedral Square in Moscow during the early 17th century, potentially showing the moment the Zemsky Sobor (the national assembly) or the people acclaimed the new tsar. It represents the setting of the event.
* The Black-and-White Image (crowd): This is almost certainly a historical photograph or an artist's depiction of the great crowd of people, nobles, clergy, and commoners gathered in Moscow for the decision of the Zemsky Sobor or for the coronation. It represents the national participation in the event.

2. The Significance of the Epoch:

The event belongs to the epoch known as the "Time of Troubles" (1598-1613) and its immediate resolution. This period is one of the most critical and traumatic in Russian history, and the election of Mikhail Romanov is its defining conclusion.

* The Crisis of the Time of Troubles: This was a perfect storm of dynastic, social, and national catastrophes:
   1. Dynastic Collapse: The end of the ancient Rurikid dynasty (1598) and the failure of the subsequent Godunov and Shuisky rules led to a devastating power vacuum.
   2. Civil War & Imposter Pretenders: The era was defined by the horrific civil wars, peasant revolts, and the appearance of "False Dmitrys" (imposters claiming to be a deceased prince), which shattered social order.
   3. Foreign Invasion: The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden exploited the chaos, occupying Moscow (the Poles even held the Kremlin) and other key lands, threatening Russia's very sovereignty.
   4. State Collapse: Central authority dissolved, leading to famine, banditry, and the near-disintegration of the state.
* The Significance of the 1613 Event: The election of 16-year-old Mikhail Romanov by the Zemsky Sobor was significant because it:
   * Ended the Civil War: It provided a universally accepted, legitimate sovereign, finally ending the internal strife. Mikhail was a compromise candidate with ties to the old dynasty (his great-aunt was Anastasia, Ivan the Terrible's beloved first wife) and was not tainted by the betrayals of the Troubles.
   * Expelled Foreign Interference: It provided a national figurehead around which the patriotic forces, led by Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky, could fully consolidate to finally drive out the Polish and Swedish occupiers.
   * Founded the Romanov Dynasty: It established the Romanov dynasty, which would rule Russia for the next 304 years (1613-1917), overseeing its transformation into a major empire.
   * Birth of National Consciousness: The successful national mobilization against the invaders, coupled with the near-destruction of the state, forged a powerful new sense of Russian national and religious identity, centered on the defense of Orthodoxy and the autocracy that had saved it.

In summary: The pictures likely show the events surrounding the election of Mikhail Romanov in 1613. This event ended the catastrophic Time of Troubles, saved Russian sovereignty from foreign partition, and founded the Romanov dynasty, initiating a three-century period of recovery, consolidation, and imperial expansion.

1. The Subject of the Painting and the Replaced Name:

The painting is by Mikhail Klodt (nephew of the more famous sculptor Pyotr Klodt), created in 1884. Its full title is "The Last Spring" or, more descriptively, it illustrates a scene from Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy's dramatic poem "Prince Serebrenni".

* The Scene Depicted: The painting shows the ghost of a young woman, along with other spectral figures, appearing at the bedside of a sleeping man. The novel's context reveals this to be a moral reckoning. The ghosts are the victims of the man's cruelty.
* The Replaced Name ("?"): The man visited by the "ghosts of those murdered innocently" is Tsar Ivan IV Vasilyevich, known as Ivan the Terrible (Иван Грозный). The "?" in the list of Russian rulers (from Question 16's text) replaces his name.

2. The Role of His Rule in Russian History:

Ivan the Terrible's reign (1533-1584) was a pivotal, complex, and terrifying era that fundamentally shaped the Russian state.

* Early Reign (The "Good" Tsar): Initially, his rule was constructive. He was crowned as the first "Tsar of All Rus'" (1547), a title asserting imperial equality with the Holy Roman Emperor and the Mongol Khan. He convened the first Zemsky Sobor (national assembly), reformed the law code (Sudebnik of 1550), established a permanent professional army (streltsy), and oversaw the expansion of the state, notably the conquest of the Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan, which opened the Volga River and Siberia to Russian expansion.
* The Oprichnina and Terror (The "Terrible" Tsar): After the death of his beloved wife and due to mounting paranoia, he instituted the Oprichnina (1565-1572). This was a state-within-a-state: a separate territory under his direct control, administered by the oprichniki (a secret police/guard dressed in black, with dog's head and broom symbols, denoting they would "sniff out and sweep away" treason). The Oprichnina unleashed a decade of mass terror, torture, and executions against the old noble boyar class, the city of Novgorod (which was sacked and massacred), and anyone Ivan suspected of disloyalty. This period is the source of the ghosts in Klodt's painting.
* Contradictory Legacy:
   * Centralization of Power: His reign decisively broke the political power of the regional nobility (boyars) and established the absolute, autocratic power of the Tsar, setting the model for future rulers.
   * Disaster and Instability: The Oprichnina and the long, draining Livonian War (which ended in failure) devastated the economy, depopulated central regions, and created a social crisis. This instability is seen as a major contributing factor to the Time of Troubles that followed the extinction of his dynasty.
   * Cultural Patronage: Paradoxically, he also oversaw a cultural flowering, including the building of St. Basil's Cathedral on Red Square.

In summary: The painting by Klodt depicts the guilty conscience of Ivan the Terrible, haunted by his victims. His rule's role was profoundly dual: he created the centralized, autocratic Russian Tsardom through imperial expansion and legal reform, but he also nearly destroyed it through the paranoid terror of the Oprichnina, leaving a legacy of both imperial grandeur and profound state trauma that led directly to the catastrophic civil wars of the following century.

Excellent. Here are detailed, fact-checked answers for Questions 16 and 17, based on the provided slide and the established historical context.

1. The Name Replaced by "?":

The name that correctly belongs in the "?" position, between Tsar Fyodor I Ivanovich and False Dmitry I, is Boris Godunov (Борис Годунов).

2. The Role of His Rule in Russian History:

Boris Godunov's reign (1598-1605) is the critical, tragic link between the end of the ancient Rurikid dynasty and the catastrophic "Time of Troubles" (Смутное Время).

* Rise to Power: He was not a royal prince but a highly capable boyar and brother-in-law to the previous, weak Tsar, Fyodor I. During Fyodor's reign, Godunov was the de facto ruler, showing great administrative skill.
* Election as Tsar (1598): When the childless Fyodor I (the last son of Ivan the Terrible) died, the ancient Rurikid dynasty became extinct. The Zemsky Sobor (national assembly) elected Boris as Tsar. This was unprecedented: a tsar not by direct dynastic right, but by election and de facto merit. This break in the natural line of succession fatally undermined the new dynasty's legitimacy in the eyes of many aristocrats and the common people.
* His Reign as Tsar:
   * Ambitious & Modernizing Start: He was an intelligent and forward-looking ruler. He pursued diplomatic openings with Western Europe, imported foreign professionals, and even planned to establish schools and a university. His reign began with promise.
   * The Great Famine (1601-1603): A series of catastrophic crop failures led to a devastating, nationwide famine. Despite organizing relief efforts (selling grain from his own stores below market price), millions died, society collapsed into banditry, and Boris's popularity evaporated. The people saw this as divine punishment for a "usurper" tsar.
   * The Appearance of the First "False Dmitry": In 1603, a man claiming to be Tsarevich Dmitry, the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible (who had died under mysterious circumstances in 1591), appeared in Poland. This impostor, supported by Poles and disaffected Russians, claimed Boris had murdered the real Dmitry to seize the throne. The widespread willingness to believe this claim demonstrated the profound lack of legitimacy of the Godunov dynasty.
* His Role in History: Boris Godunov's rule represents the fragile and ill-fated attempt to establish a new, non-Rurikid dynasty. His personal abilities were undermined by natural disaster and, more importantly, by the deep-seated Russian tradition of hereditary succession. His death in 1605 opened the floodgates for the Time of Troubles—a period of civil war, foreign invasion, and a succession of more than a dozen claimants and impostors (as shown in the flowchart: False Dmitry I, then Vasily Shuisky). Thus, Boris is a pivotal figure: his reign was both the last period of stable rule before the chaos and, due to its contested legitimacy, the direct cause of that chaos.

1. The Connection Between the Two People:

* "Saint Prince Dmitriy": This refers to Saint Dmitry (Dmitri) Donskoy (1350-1389), the Grand Prince of Moscow and Vladimir. He is revered as a saint for his defense of the Russian lands and the Orthodox faith, most famously for his victory at the Battle of Kulikovo Field (1380) against the Mongols of the Golden Horde.
* "Dmetrius Emperor Moscoviae": This is a contemporaneous European portrait of False Dmitry I (reigned 1605-1606), an impostor who claimed to be Tsarevich Dmitry, the son of Ivan the Terrible. He seized the throne with Polish support during the Time of Troubles.

The Connection: The connection is in the name and the claim, but a total inversion in substance and historical meaning.

Both figures are named Dmitry (Dmitri). However, one is the genuine, canonized national hero, Prince Dmitry Donskoy, who defended Russia from foreign domination. The other is the archetypal impostor, False Dmitry I, whose fraudulent claim (to be a different Tsarevich Dmitry) ushered in a period of foreign invasion and national collapse. The exam question juxtaposes the "true" Dmitry, a symbol of unity and victory, with the "false" Dmitry, a symbol of deception, foreign intrigue, and state disintegration.

2. The Significance of the Epoch When Dmitry Donskoy Ruled:

Dmitry Donskoy's rule (1359-1389) marks the crucial turning point in the struggle for Russian independence from the Mongol Yoke and the rise of Moscow as the undisputed national leader.

* Consolidation of Moscow's Power: He successfully defended Moscow's leadership against rival principalities (like Tver) and the powerful Grand Duchy of Lithuania, cementing Moscow's role as the "gatherer of the Russian lands."
* The Battle of Kulikovo (1380): This is the defining event of his reign and one of the most significant in Russian history. For the first time, a united Russian army led by the Prince of Moscow, not as a rebel but as a national leader, inflicted a massive defeat on the Golden Horde's forces. Although the Horde reasserted control two years later, the myth of Mongol invincibility was shattered.
* Spiritual and National Significance: The battle was framed as a holy war for Orthodox Christianity against the Muslim Horde. The blessing of St. Sergius of Radonezh (from Question 12) was pivotal. Victory created a powerful new narrative: Moscow as the defender of the faith and the Russian people, the successor to Kiev, and the rightful political center. This solidified the alliance between the Moscow princes and the Orthodox Church.
* Legacy: While political independence would take another century to achieve (finalized in 1480 at the Standoff on the Ugra River), Kulikovo provided the psychological and moral foundation for that future independence. Dmitry Donskoy's reign transformed the principality of Moscow from a successful Mongol vassal into the acknowledged leader of the national liberation struggle. The epoch signifies the moment when the Russian lands, led by Moscow, stopped seeing themselves solely as victims and began to see themselves as potential victors.

In summary: The two Dmitrys are connected by name but represent polar opposites: the saintly unifier versus the fraudulent usurper. The epoch of the real Dmitry (Donskoy) is significant as the moment when Moscow-led Russia began its definitive, spiritually charged military and political struggle for independence from the Mongol Empire.

Based on the provided image, here are the detailed explanations and answers for Questions 18 and 19, continuing with the established historical context of the Time of Troubles.

# 18

1. Who of the two men is Minin, and who is Pozharsky?

The famous bronze monument on Red Square, in front of St. Basil's Cathedral, depicts the two national heroes of 1612. The identification is as follows:

* The man standing and gesturing with an outstretched arm is Kuzma Minin. He is a commoner, a Nizhny Novgorod merchant.
* The man seated, holding a large sword and a shield is Prince Dmitry Pozharsky. He is a Rurikid noble and a military commander.

Minin, the civilian, is shown in a dynamic pose, rallying the people and presenting Pozharsky, the military leader, with the sword of command. Pozharsky, though weakened from wounds, accepts the duty, symbolizing the union of the people and the nobility.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history when they did their famous deed?

Their famous deed was organizing and leading the National Militia (Народное ополчение) in 1611-1612, which liberated Moscow from the Polish-Lithish occupation. This act was the turning point of the Time of Troubles (Смутное время).

* The Context: By 1611, Russia was in a state of collapse. The Polish army occupied Moscow, a Polish prince was claiming the throne, and Sweden had seized Novgorod. There was no legitimate tsar, and the state had disintegrated.
* Their Achievement: In Nizhny Novgorod, the merchant Kuzma Minin initiated a patriotic movement, collecting funds and rallying the people. He insisted that Prince Dmitry Pozharsky, a respected military commander, lead the army. Together, they formed a united force of nobles, townspeople, Cossacks, and peasants. After fierce fighting, their militia stormed Moscow's Kitai-gorod and liberated the Kremlin from Polish forces in October 1612.
* Historical Significance: This victory made it possible to reconvene the Zemsky Sobor (national assembly), which, freed from foreign pressure, could elect a new tsar. In 1613, they chose Mikhail Romanov, founding the Romanov dynasty. Therefore, the epoch is significant as the moment of national resurrection. It demonstrated the possibility of unity across social classes to save the homeland, ended the period of foreign intervention, and created the conditions for the restoration of a legitimate, sovereign Russian state. The monument symbolizes this unity and patriotic sacrifice.

# 19

1. What is the role of Feodor Chaliapin (on the photo) in this play?

The play is not a play but an opera: "A Life for the Tsar" (Жизнь за царя), also known as "Ivan Susanin", composed by Mikhail Glinka (premiered in 1836). It is the foundational work of Russian classical music.

Feodor Chaliapin (Шаляпин) was the greatest Russian operatic bass of the 20th century. While he was famously associated with the title role in Modest Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, he was also renowned for his powerful portrayal of Ivan Susanin, the central protagonist of Glinka's opera. Therefore, in this opera, Chaliapin would have performed the title role of the peasant hero, Ivan Susanin.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history which is presented in the play?

The opera is set in the exact same epoch as the deeds of Minin and Pozharsky: the end of the Time of Troubles, specifically in 1613.

* The Plot: The story is based on a (likely legendary) historical episode. A Polish military detachment searches for the newly elected, young Tsar Mikhail Romanov to capture or kill him. They force a peasant from the Romanov estate, Ivan Susanin, to guide them. Susanin deliberately leads the Polish troops deep into an impenetrable forest, sacrificing his own life. His deed allows the tsar to reach safety, securing the future of the dynasty and the state.
* Historical & Ideological Significance: The epoch depicted is, once again, the final, pivotal crisis of the Time of Troubles. The opera's significance lies in how it interprets this history for the 19th-century Russian Empire:
   1. National Myth-Making: It transforms the historical narrative into a powerful national myth. The peasant Susanin becomes the ultimate symbol of loyalty, self-sacrifice, and the unbreakable bond between the common people and the divinely-ordained tsar.
   2. Unity of All Estates: Just as the Minin/Pozharsky monument shows noble and commoner united, the opera shows the peasantry's crucial role in saving the monarchy. It presents an ideal of national unity across social strata (the sobornost concept).
   3. Legitimization of the Romanovs: By glorifying the sacrifice that ensured Mikhail Romanov's safety, the opera powerfully legitimizes the ruling Romanov dynasty, suggesting its rule was won and preserved by the people's love and sacrifice.

In summary: Chaliapin played the heroic peasant Ivan Susanin. The opera depicts the same critical epoch (1612-1613) as Question 18, but its significance lies in its 19th-century function: to create a potent national founding myth that celebrated autocracy, popular piety, and the sacred union between the tsar and his people, using the story of the Time of Troubles as its foundational drama.

Here are detailed, fact-checked answers for Questions 20 and 21, based on the provided image and context.

# 20

1. The Social and Political Movement:

The social and political movement that initiated the "dispute on the faith" depicted in Vasily Perov's painting is the Raskol (Раскол), known in English as the Great Schism or Old Believers' Schism, within the Russian Orthodox Church.

2. The Epoch and Its Role in Russian History:

* The Epoch: The Schism began in the mid-17th century, precisely during the reign of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich (1645-1676) and under the patriarchate of Patriarch Nikon (1652-1666). This period is often seen as the transition from medieval Muscovy to the early Russian Empire.
* What Happened: Patriarch Nikon, with the Tsar's support, instituted a series of reforms to correct Russian liturgical books and rituals (e.g., the spelling of Jesus, the number of fingers used to make the sign of the cross, the direction of processions) to align them with contemporary Greek Orthodox practices. His goal was to assert Moscow's role as the center of Orthodox Christianity ("the Third Rome") by ensuring its practices were the most correct and universal.
* The Resulting Dispute: These changes were violently opposed by a significant portion of the clergy and laity, led by figures like the archpriest Avvakum. They saw the reforms as a corruption of the true, ancient Russian faith that had saved Holy Rus'. The dispute was not about minor ritual details but about the very essence of Russian identity: was it the guardian of unique, sacred traditions, or was it to submit to external (Greek) authority for the sake of a universal Orthodox polity?
* The Role of the Epoch in Russian History:
   1. Profound Religious and Social Split: The state church anathematized the "Old Believers" (or "Old Ritualists"), leading to a brutal persecution that lasted for centuries. The Raskol created a permanent, large, and persecuted minority within Russian society, fracturing its religious unity.
   2. Crisis of Authority and "The Third Rome" Ideology: The Schism shattered the previously unshakeable unity between the people, the church, and the state. The idea of Moscow as the "Third Rome"—the last bastion of true faith—was undermined when the state itself was seen as betraying that faith. This created a deep cultural trauma and a legacy of popular suspicion toward state-imposed reform.
   3. Precursor to Peter the Great's Reforms: The state's brutal suppression of the Old Believers demonstrated its willingness to use absolute power to break traditional society for its own modernizing goals. In this sense, Nikon's reforms were a dress rehearsal for the much more radical, secular Westernization that Peter the Great would impose from above just a few decades later. The epoch established a pattern of top-down transformation met with popular resistance.

In summary: The painting depicts the Raskol (Great Schism). This epoch of the mid-17th century was pivotal because it created a deep, lasting fracture in Russian society and the church, demonstrated the increasing power of the autocratic state over spiritual life, and set the stage for the even more transformative reign of Peter the Great.

# 21

1. The City and Its Purpose:

* The City: The city poetized by Alexander Pushkin in the provided lines (from his narrative poem "The Bronze Horseman") is Saint Petersburg (Санкт-Петербург). The lines describe the Neva River, the city's ornate railings, its pensive nights, and the Admiralty spire.
* Why It Was Created: St. Petersburg was founded by Tsar Peter the Great in 1703 with a clear, radical purpose: to be a "window to Europe" (окно в Европу).
   1. Strategic & Military: To secure Russia's access to the Baltic Sea, which he had just won from Sweden in the Great Northern War, and to establish a modern naval base and port.
   2. Political & Cultural: To create a new, modern capital that would break decisively with the old, "Asiatic" traditions of Moscow. It was to be a symbol of the new, Europeanized, rational, and secular Russia that Peter was building. It was a city built from scratch by decree, using Western European architecture and urban planning, intended to be Russia's gateway to Western science, technology, and culture.

2. The Significance of the Epoch:

The epoch during which St. Petersburg came into existence is the reign of Peter the Great (1682-1725), particularly the period after his Grand Embassy to Europe (1697-98) and his victory in the Great Northern War (1700-1721). This epoch is one of the most significant in all of Russian history.

* A Forced Revolution from Above: Peter's reign was not mere reform; it was a cultural revolution designed to forcibly drag Russia into the ranks of the great European powers. This involved:
   * Modernization of the State and Army: He created a modern, professional standing army and navy, a new bureaucratic apparatus (the Table of Ranks), and subordinated the church to the state (abolishing the Patriarchate, creating the Holy Synod).
   * Cultural Westernization: He forced the nobility to shave beards, wear European clothes, adopt social manners, and seek education. He promoted science, founded the first Russian museum and public newspaper, and simplified the Cyrillic alphabet.
   * Economic and Industrial Push: He developed mining, manufacturing, and trade, often using state control and serf labor.
* Dual Legacy and the "Petersburg Period": The founding of St. Petersburg encapsulates Peter's entire project and its dual legacy:
   1. The Rise of an Empire: His victory over Sweden made Russia the dominant power in the Baltic. In 1721, he was proclaimed Emperor (Император), and Russia was officially renamed the Russian Empire. The epoch marks Russia's definitive arrival as a major European imperial power.
   2. A Profound National Schism: The building of St. Petersburg on the swamps of the Neva, at a colossal human cost (thousands of serfs died), became a powerful symbol. For some, it was a glorious capital of progress (as in Pushkin's line "I love thee, city of Peter's making"). For others, it was an unnatural, alien city imposed on the Russian landscape, symbolizing the state's violent rupture with the national past (a theme Pushkin also explores in "The Bronze Horseman"). The epoch thus cemented a lasting tension in Russian identity between Westernizing modernization and nativist tradition.

In summary: The city is Saint Petersburg, created as a "window to Europe" and a symbol of a new, modern Russia. Its founding epoch under Peter the Great marks Russia's transformation into a secular, bureaucratic, European-style empire, a process that was monumental in its achievements but also profoundly traumatic, creating a cultural divide that would define Russian intellectual and political life for centuries.

# 22

1. Which Russian ruler is depicted in this picture?

The ruler depicted is Peter I Alexeyevich, known as Peter the Great (Пётр I Великий) (1672-1725).

2. What changed in Russia during his reign, and what is the role of that epoch?

Peter the Great's reign (1682-1725, with sole rule from 1696) was a period of revolutionary transformation that altered every aspect of the Russian state and society. The painting of him at a shipyard perfectly symbolizes the core of his reforms.

* Fundamental Changes:
   * Military & Statehood: He created a modern, professional standing army and navy (the Baltic Fleet, as shown in the painting) from scratch, which allowed Russia to defeat the Swedish Empire in the Great Northern War (1700-1721). In 1721, he was proclaimed Emperor (Император), and Russia was renamed the Russian Empire.
   * Administrative Modernization: He dismantled the old boyar Duma and created a new, European-style bureaucratic system (the Governing Senate, Colleges) and the Table of Ranks, which tied noble status to state service rather than just birth.
   * Cultural Westernization: He forcibly Europeanized the Russian elite: beards were taxed, Western clothing was mandated, and new forms of social life (assemblies) were introduced. He promoted secular education, founded the Russian Academy of Sciences, and simplified the Cyrillic alphabet.
   * Economic & Industrial Policy: He aggressively developed mining, manufacturing, and trade, often using state capital and serf labor, to support his military ambitions. This is directly linked to figures like Nikita Demidov (Question 23).
   * Symbolic Geography: He founded a new capital, Saint Petersburg (1703), on the Baltic coast as a "window to Europe," physically turning Russia towards the West and away from its Moscow-centered past.
* The Role of the Epoch:This epoch marks the definitive break between medieval Muscovy and the modern Russian Empire. Peter's reign is the pivotal "revolution from above" that thrust Russia into the European state system as a major power. Its role is dual:
   1. It established the foundations of Russia's imperial greatness, its modern state institutions, and its military might.
   2. It created a profound and lasting cultural schism between a Westernized elite and the traditional masses, and established the model of autocratic power using coercive means to modernize society—a pattern that would echo for centuries. The epoch is, therefore, the birthplace of both imperial Russia and its central historical tensions.

# 23

1. What is Nikita Demidov famous for?

Nikita Demidovich Antufyev, better known as Nikita Demidov (1656-1725), was a Tula blacksmith and weapons manufacturer who became the founding patriarch of the Demidov family, Russia's most powerful and wealthy industrial dynasty in the 18th-19th centuries. He is famous for:

* Establishing the foundation of the Ural mining and metallurgical empire. He used his skill and entrepreneurship to fulfill Peter the Great's colossal orders for weapons, especially for the army and navy during the Great Northern War.
* Building numerous state-of-the-art iron and copper plants in the Urals, which became the primary industrial base for Russia, supplying metal for military hardware, cannons, and later for civilian use. His factories were crucial to Russia's victory over Sweden and its rise as a great power.

2. Why is this monument erected in one of the Urals cities?

The monument is in the Urals because that region was the heartland of the Demidov industrial empire. Cities like Nizhny Tagil and Yekaterinburg were essentially founded and built by the Demidovs around their plants. Erecting a monument there honors the man (and the dynasty) that transformed the Urals from a remote frontier into the industrial backbone of the Russian Empire.

3. Who is the second man on the monument, and why is he present?

The second man, seated on a higher pedestal, dressed in simpler attire, is almost certainly Tsar Peter the Great.

4. What is his role in Russian history, and why is he present here?

Peter the Great's role is detailed above. He is present on the monument with Demidov to symbolize their historic partnership. Their relationship epitomizes Peter's entire modernization project:

* The Patron and the Visionary: Peter provided the vision, the demand, and the resources (land, serfs, mineral rights) needed for rapid industrialization.
* The Entrepreneur and the Executor: Demidov provided the practical skill, managerial genius, and drive to realize Peter's vision on an unprecedented scale.The monument commemorates the alliance between the autocratic state and entrepreneurial talent that powered Russia's transformation. Peter recognized and nurtured Demidov's talent, and Demidov, in turn, became one of the chief engines of Peter's ambition. Together, they represent the force that built imperial Russia's industrial and military might.
