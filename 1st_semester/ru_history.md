The Question:"What grounds did Alexander Block have to write the following expression? What is the true origin of the Russians?"
The Provided Text:
The text is an excerpt from the poem "The Scythians" (Скифы) written by Alexander Blok in 1918.
* Russian Excerpt: The provided Cyrillic text contains several errors (e.g., "ягодыни охлани" is a severe distortion of the correct line "жадными очами"). The correct final two lines are: "Да, скифы — мы! Да, азиаты — мы, / С раскосыми и жадными очами!"* English Translation: The provided English translation is interpretive and takes significant liberties. A more standard, literal translation is: "Yes, we are Scythians! Yes, we are Asiatics, / With slanted and greedy eyes!"

Answer and Explanation:

1. Alexander Blok's "Grounds" (Historical & Ideological Context):
   * The Poem's Moment: Blok wrote "The Scythians" in January 1918, immediately after the Bolsheviks dissolved the Russian Constituent Assembly. This was a moment of immense turmoil, with World War I ongoing and the Russian Civil War beginning. The poem is addressed to the "Old World" of Europe.
   * The "Scythian" Myth: Blok is using a powerful historical metaphor. The Scythians were ancient nomadic tribes of the Eurasian steppes, often portrayed in classical Greek history as the archetypal "barbarian" other—fierce, uncivilized, and a constant threat to the settled, "civilized" West.
   * Blok's Message: Blok identifies revolutionary Russia with these Scythians. His "grounds" are not genetic or anthropological but cultural-political and metaphysical. He is arguing that Russia represents a primordial, elemental, and "Asiatic" force that Europe has always feared and misunderstood. The poem is both a warning to Europe not to interfere in the Russian Revolution and a declaration of Russia's unique, non-European identity. It taps into a long-standing Russian intellectual debate between "Westernizers" and "Slavophiles," positioning Russia as a distinct Eurasian civilization.
2. The "True Origin" of the Russians (Fact-Checking & Modern Science):
   * Clarifying the Question: The exam question seems to conflate Blok's metaphorical use of "Scythians" with a literal ethnic origin. This is a common misconception that the question itself might be prompting the student to correct.
   * Historical Facts:
      * Scythians: They were predominantly an Iranian-speaking confederation of nomadic tribes dominant in the Pontic-Caspian steppe from approximately the 7th century BC to the 3rd century AD. They were largely assimilated or displaced by later migrations, including the Sarmatians, Goths, and Huns.
      * Slavs (the ancestors of Russians): The early Slavs emerged as a distinct linguistic and cultural group in Central/Eastern Europe much later, around the 5th-6th centuries AD. Their homeland is debated but was likely north of the Carpathian Mountains, in regions like present-day Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus—areas that were, centuries earlier, on the periphery of Scythian influence.
   * Genetic & Archaeological Consensus: There is no direct lineal descent of the Russian people from the Scythians. The ethnogenesis of the Russians is primarily from:
      * Early East Slavic tribes (like the Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs, Vyatichs).
      * Assimilation of Finno-Ugric tribes (indigenous populations of the North Russian forests).
      * A significant Scandinavian (Varangian) element among the ruling elite in the early Kyivan Rus' state (9th-11th centuries).
      * Later influences from Turkic, Baltic, and other groups.
Conclusion to Question #2: Alexander Blok's grounds were poetic and ideological, using the Scythian metaphor to express Russia's revolutionary, anti-Western, and Eurasian identity in 1918. Scientifically, the "true origin" of the Russians is not from the Scythians, but primarily from the later East Slavic tribes, with significant Finno-Ugric and Scandinavian components.

The Question:

"These two pictures illustrate the same legend about the origin of the Russian state. What caused furious disputes about the legend? What is the scientific reply to the question disputed?"

Inference from Context:

Since the pictures are not visible but are described as illustrating a legend about the origin of the Russian state, the legend is almost certainly the "Calling of the Varangians" (or the Normanist theory).

* The Legend: As recorded in the Russian Primary Chronicle (12th century), the Slavic and Finnic tribes of the Novgorod region, mired in internecine conflict, invited the Varangian (Scandinavian) chieftain Rurik and his brothers to rule over them in 862. Rurik established himself in Novgorod, founding the Rurikid dynasty, which ruled Kyivan Rus' and later Muscovy/Russia for over 700 years.

Detailed Answer

The Legend: The two pictures illustrate the foundational legend of the Russian state as recorded in the "Tale of Bygone Years" (The Russian Primary Chronicle), compiled in the 12th century. The legend is known as "The Calling of the Varangians" or the "Invitation to Rurik."

According to the Chronicle, in the year 862, the various Slavic (Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs) and Finno-Ugric (Chud, Ves, etc.) tribes in the region of Novgorod, tired of internal conflict and lacking order, decided to seek a ruler from abroad. They are quoted as saying, "Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us." They invited the Varangian (Scandinavian) chieftain Rurik and his brothers, Sineus and Truvor. Rurik settled in Novgorod (or Ladoga), founding the Rurikid Dynasty, which ruled Kievan Rus' and its successor states (including Muscovy and early Tsardom of Russia) until 1598.

1. What Caused the Furious Disputes About the Legend?

The disputes form the core of the "Normanist Question" (Normanist vs. Anti-Normanist Debate), which has been one of the most heated and politicized debates in Russian historiography for nearly 300 years. The fury stems from its implications for Russian national identity, origins, and political ideology.

* The Normanist Position (Origins in 18th Century German Historians): This view accepts the basic validity of the chronicle's account. It argues that the Scandinavians (Vikings/Varangians) were the decisive, organizing force in the creation of the first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus'. They point to:
   * The name "Rus" itself, which they derive from the Old Norse term "róðr" (a crew of oarsmen) or from "Ruotsi," the Finnish name for Sweden.
   * Archaeological evidence of significant Scandinavian presence in key trade centers like Staraya Ladoga, Novgorod, and Gnezdovo (near Smolensk) in the 9th-10th centuries.
   * The names of the first Rus' princes and ambassadors in Byzantine treaties, which are overwhelmingly Norse (e.g., Oleg = Helgi, Olga = Helga, Igor = Ingvar).
   * The testimony of contemporary foreign sources (Byzantine, Arab) that distinguish the "Rus" as a group separate from the Slavs.
* The Anti-Normanist Position (A Reaction with Nationalist & Political Dimensions): This view rejects the Chronicle's account as a later fabrication or misinterpretation. It argues that the Slavic state was an entirely indigenous development, and the Varangian role was minimal, mercenary, or mythical. The "furious" nature of the dispute arises because:
   * National Pride: The idea that the Russian state was founded by "foreigners" (Germans/Scandinavians) was seen as an insult to national dignity, especially from the 19th century onward as Romantic nationalism grew.
   * Soviet Ideology: Under Stalin, the Normanist theory was officially condemned as "bourgeois falsification" that denied the Slavic peoples' capacity for independent state formation—a key tenet of Marxist historical materialism. Anti-Normanism became state doctrine, and archaeologists/historians who argued for a significant Norse role faced severe persecution.
   * Modern Politics: The debate continues to resonate, with some modern Russian nationalists and "patriotic" historians strongly promoting Anti-Normanist views, seeing the Normanist theory as a Western plot to diminish Russia's historical stature.

In essence, the dispute is furious because it is not just an academic quarrel about archaeology, but a battle over the founding myth of the Russian nation: Was it created from within by the Slavic people, or catalyzed from without by Viking outsiders?

2. What is the Scientific Reply to the Question Disputed?

Modern scholarship, based on decades of interdisciplinary research (archaeology, linguistics, numismatics, comparative chronicle study), has moved beyond the rigid "either/or" dichotomy to a nuanced synthetic consensus. The scientific reply deconstructs the legend and provides a complex, evidence-based picture.

1. The Legend as Foundational Myth: Scholars agree the Chronicle story is a mythologized, later construction (written 300 years after the events) designed to:

* Give the ruling Rurikid dynasty a legitimate and prestigious foreign origin.
* Explain the name "Rus."
* Portray the founding of the state as a peaceful, legal contract, not a conquest.

2. The Consensus on Historical Reality:

* Indigenous Development: The region was not empty. Complex tribal societies of Slavs, Balts, and Finno-Ugric peoples existed, with their own social stratification, trade, and proto-urban centers (like the gorodishche near future Novgorod).
* The Crucial Role of Trade: The Volkhov-Dnieper river system ("The Route from the Varangians to the Greeks") was the economic engine. Control of this trade in furs, slaves, silver, and luxury goods generated the wealth and inter-tribal connections necessary for state formation.
* The Varangians as Catalyst and Elite: Here is the key synthesis: Scandinavian Vikings (Varangians) were not the "creators" of the Slavic people or their culture, but they became the dominant military-commercial elite that unified the pre-existing tribal structures under a new political framework. They were the armed traders and warriors who mastered the long-distance routes, established key fortified trading posts (emporia), and eventually took political control of them.
* The "Invitation" Trope: The concept of "inviting a ruler" is a common medieval literary trope to legitimize power. In reality, the process likely involved a combination of trade, mercenary service, conflict, and gradual assumption of power by a successful Varangian warlord (like the historical Rurik) and his retinue (druzhina).
* Rapid Assimilation: Critically, the Scandinavian elite was small. Within a generation or two, they had completely assimilated into the local Slavic majority, adopting their language, customs, and identity. By the time of Vladimir the Great (late 10th century), the rulers were culturally Slavic Orthodox princes, not Norse pagans.

Final Scientific Reply: The furious dispute is based on a false dichotomy. The modern scientific view holds that the origin of the Russian state was a complex process of internal socio-economic development among the Eastern Slavs, which was critically accelerated, unified, and politically led by a Scandinavian warrior-trading elite. The state of Kievan Rus' was born from the synergy between the Slavic-Finnic substrate and the Varangian superstrate. The legend of Rurik's calling preserves a kernel of truth about the foreign origin of its first dynasty, but not about the origin of the Russian people themselves.

Of course. Based on the provided screenshot, here are detailed explanations and answers for Questions 4 and 5. The facts have been cross-referenced with established historical scholarship.

The Image & The Scene:

The medieval-style illustration depicts Princess Olga of Kiev (c. 920–969), the ruler of Kievan Rus'. The specific scene illustrated is a famous episode from the Primary Chronicle describing her bloody revenge against the Drevlians, the tribe that killed her husband, Prince Igor.
"Why is the woman on the right taking a bath in the presence of the two men?"
Short Answer: She is not taking a bath. It is a trap, and she is having them burned alive.

Detailed Context: After executing several initial acts of revenge on the Drevlians, Olga promised to forgive them and asked for a show of honor. The Drevlians sent their best men to escort her. The chronicle then states: "Olga commanded that a bath be prepared for them, inviting them to wash after their long journey. When the men entered the bathhouse, Olga had it set on fire, and they were all burned to death." The illustration you see captures the moment the Drevlians enter the bathhouse before it is sealed and ignited. The two men are Drevlian ambassadors/nobles, and Olga is overseeing the execution of her elaborate scheme.

1."What differed her as a ruler from the preceding Russian dukes (princes)?"

Princess Olga is a monumental figure who differed from her predecessors (like Oleg, Igor, and her own husband) in two fundamental ways:
1. She was the first major female ruler. She ruled as regent for her young son, Sviatoslav, but exercised power with exceptional skill and authority, securing the state during a vulnerable transition.
2. She was the first Christian ruler of Kievan Rus' and a key civilizing reformer. While her predecessors were pagan warriors focused on conquest and tribute, Olga instituted a systematic, peaceful administration.

Administrative Reforms: She established a system of "pogosts" (administrative and trading centers) and standardized tribute collection, moving away from the chaotic, violent "poludie" (tribute-gathering tours) that got her husband killed.
Religious Significance: Baptized in Constantinople (c. 957), she became the first Christian in the Rus' ruling dynasty. Although she failed to convert her pagan son, her baptism planted the seed for the official Christianization of Rus' under her grandson, Vladimir the Great, in 988. For this, she is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church (Equal-to-the-Apostles).

Summary: She transitioned the ruler's role from a pagan warlord ("knyaz") to a Christian monarch focused on state-building, law, and diplomacy with the Byzantine Empire.

The Image & The City:
The reconstructed red-brick and wood fortress is part of the Kievan Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves) or the general fortifications of Kiev (Kyiv), the capital of modern Ukraine. The question confirms the city is Kiev.
"How did it happen that this city became the 'mother to the Russian cities'..."
The phrase "mother of Russian cities" is a direct translation from the Old East Slavic chronicles ("матерь городам русским"). Kiev earned this title because:
Political Capital: Under Prince Oleg (who moved there from Novgorod around 882), it became the capital of the Rurikid dynasty and the unified state of Kievan Rus'.
Religious & Cultural Center: After the Baptism of Rus' in 988 under Vladimir the Great, Kiev became the seat of the Metropolitan (the head of the Orthodox Church in the region). The magnificent Cathedral of Holy Wisdom (St. Sophia) and the Kiev Pechersk Lavra became centers of liturgy, art, literature, and law (e.g., Russkaya Pravda).
Source of Identity: For centuries, "Rus'" referred primarily to the land around Kiev. The shared Christian faith, dynastic rule, and culture that emanated from Kiev provided the foundational identity for the East Slavic peoples (the ancestors of modern Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians).
"...and how it found itself beyond the Russian borders?"
This refers to Kiev not being part of the modern state of the Russian Federation.

Historical Process:
Decline & Fragmentation (12th-13th centuries): After the death of Vladimir Monomakh, Kievan Rus' fragmented into rival principalities. The political and economic center began shifting north-east to Vladimir-Suzdal and later Moscow.
Mongol Destruction (1240): The Mongol invasion under Batu Khan sacked and devastated Kiev, breaking its power permanently.
Divergent Paths: The historical lands of Rus' developed under different dominions:
The north-east (including Moscow) evolved into the Tsardom of Russia.
The south-west (including Kiev) came under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Modern Borders: Kiev remained a central city for the Ukrainian people. After periods of Cossack autonomy and rule by the Russian Empire, the modern state of Ukraine was formed in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Kiev became the capital of the independent nation of Ukraine, thus placing it "beyond the borders" of the Russian Federation.

Conclusion: Kiev became the "mother of Russian cities" as the first political, religious, and cultural capital of the medieval East Slavic civilization, Kievan Rus'. It now lies outside Russia's borders due to the medieval fragmentation of that civilization, centuries of separate political development under Lithuanian/Polish rule, and the establishment of the modern independent state of Ukraine in the late 20th century.

Of course. Here are the detailed explanations and answers for Questions 6 and 7, based on the provided descriptions.

The Subject:The monuments shown are dedicated to Yaroslav I, known as Yaroslav the Wise (Ярослав Мудрый) (c. 978–1054), Grand Prince of Kiev.

Answer and Explanation:

1. Why the Monuments are in These Specific Cities:
   * Kiev: As the capital, it was the seat of Yaroslav's power. His reign is considered the golden age of Kievan Rus'. The most famous monument to him stands near the Golden Gate, and his greatest architectural achievement, the Cathedral of Saint Sophia, is a UNESCO World Heritage site built under his rule.
   * Novgorod: Before ruling in Kiev, Yaroslav was the Prince of Novgorod. It was from here that he launched the campaign to claim the Kievan throne from his brother. He granted the city a degree of self-governance and a charter of laws, which strengthened its importance. A monument to him is part of the city's historical landscape.
   * Yaroslavl: This city is named after him. According to legend, he founded the city on the Volga River. Monuments to its founder are, therefore, central to the city's identity.
2. His Role in Russian History:Yaroslav the Wise was one of the most important rulers of Kievan Rus'. His role was transformative:
   * Consolidator of the State: He defeated his rivals and reunited the core lands of Rus', ending a period of fratricidal war. His long reign (1019–1054) brought internal stability.
   * Lawgiver: He oversaw the creation and codification of the first written Slavic law code, the "Russkaya Pravda" (Русская Правда, "Justice of Rus'"). This laid the legal foundation for the state for centuries.
   * Builder and Patron of Culture: He transformed Kiev into a major European capital, building the Saint Sophia Cathedral (rivaling Constantinople's Hagia Sophia), the Golden Gate, and monasteries. His court became a center for chronicle-writing, translation of Greek texts, and education.
   * International Statesman: He created a web of dynastic marriages linking Rus' to the royal houses of Europe (France, Hungary, Norway) and the Byzantine Empire, elevating Rus' to a major European power.

Conclusion for Q6: The monuments honor Yaroslav the Wise, the ruler who solidified Kievan Rus' as a stable, law-governed, Christian European power and a major center of culture and architecture.

# 7
The Subject:The text and monuments refer to Vladimir II Monomakh (Владимир Мономах) (1053–1125), Grand Prince of Kiev.

Answer and Explanation:

1. Identifying the Author from the Text:The provided text is a direct excerpt from Monomakh's most famous work, "The Instruction (or Testament) to My Children" (Поучение детям). It is a unique piece of medieval literature—part autobiography, part moral guide, and part political memoir written by a ruling prince for his sons.
   * The text describes a specific historical event: his conflict with Prince Oleg of Chernigov (his cousin) in 1076, where Monomakh chose to cede Chernigov to avoid further bloodshed among Christian Slavs, retreating to the smaller town of Pereslavl. His reflection, "I took pity on the souls of our Christian subjects...", is a hallmark of his writing, emphasizing piety, responsibility, and the avoidance of fratricidal strife.
2. His Role in Russian History:Vladimir Monomakh played a critical role during the beginning of Rus' fragmentation.
   * Last Unifier: He became Grand Prince of Kiev in 1113, not by the usual order of succession, but by popular acclaim of the Kievans to quell a rebellion. He was the last ruler to exercise substantial authority over the increasingly divided and rivalrous principalities of Kievan Rus'.
   * Lawmaker: He added new articles to the "Russkaya Pravda," regulating debts and the status of commoners, showing concern for social order.
   * Military Leader and Diplomat: He is most famous for organizing and leading a series of successful united campaigns against the Cumans (Polovtsians), the nomadic steppe people who constantly raided Rus' lands. His "Instruction" contains vivid accounts of these campaigns. He also used dynastic marriages to secure Rus' borders.
   * Cultural Figure: His "Instruction" is a priceless historical document and literary masterpiece, offering a rare personal voice from the period on rulership, faith, and ethics. It solidified his image as the ideal Christian prince—brave, pious, and wise.
3. The Monuments:The two statues (a bust and a seated figure) are common representations of Monomakh. He is often depicted as a thoughtful, bearded ruler, sometimes holding a cross or a scroll (symbolizing his "Instruction" or the law). Such monuments to him can be found in cities like Moscow (where he is considered a symbolic predecessor of the Muscovite tsars) and Chernigov.
Conclusion: The person is Vladimir Monomakh. His role was that of the last effective ruler of a united Kievan Rus', a famed military leader against the steppe nomads, a lawgiver, and the author of a seminal literary work that defined the ideals of princely rule in Russian culture.
