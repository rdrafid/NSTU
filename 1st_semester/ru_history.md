The Question:"What grounds did Alexander Block have to write the following expression? What is the true origin of the Russians?"
The Provided Text:
The text is an excerpt from the poem "The Scythians" (Скифы) written by Alexander Blok in 1918.
* Russian Excerpt: The provided Cyrillic text contains several errors (e.g., "ягодыни охлани" is a severe distortion of the correct line "жадными очами"). The correct final two lines are: "Да, скифы — мы! Да, азиаты — мы, / С раскосыми и жадными очами!"* English Translation: The provided English translation is interpretive and takes significant liberties. A more standard, literal translation is: "Yes, we are Scythians! Yes, we are Asiatics, / With slanted and greedy eyes!"

Answer and Explanation:

1. Alexander Blok's "Grounds" (Historical & Ideological Context):
   * The Poem's Moment: Blok wrote "The Scythians" in January 1918, immediately after the Bolsheviks dissolved the Russian Constituent Assembly. This was a moment of immense turmoil, with World War I ongoing and the Russian Civil War beginning. The poem is addressed to the "Old World" of Europe.
   * The "Scythian" Myth: Blok is using a powerful historical metaphor. The Scythians were ancient nomadic tribes of the Eurasian steppes, often portrayed in classical Greek history as the archetypal "barbarian" other—fierce, uncivilized, and a constant threat to the settled, "civilized" West.
   * Blok's Message: Blok identifies revolutionary Russia with these Scythians. His "grounds" are not genetic or anthropological but cultural-political and metaphysical. He is arguing that Russia represents a primordial, elemental, and "Asiatic" force that Europe has always feared and misunderstood. The poem is both a warning to Europe not to interfere in the Russian Revolution and a declaration of Russia's unique, non-European identity. It taps into a long-standing Russian intellectual debate between "Westernizers" and "Slavophiles," positioning Russia as a distinct Eurasian civilization.
2. The "True Origin" of the Russians (Fact-Checking & Modern Science):
   * Clarifying the Question: The exam question seems to conflate Blok's metaphorical use of "Scythians" with a literal ethnic origin. This is a common misconception that the question itself might be prompting the student to correct.
   * Historical Facts:
      * Scythians: They were predominantly an Iranian-speaking confederation of nomadic tribes dominant in the Pontic-Caspian steppe from approximately the 7th century BC to the 3rd century AD. They were largely assimilated or displaced by later migrations, including the Sarmatians, Goths, and Huns.
      * Slavs (the ancestors of Russians): The early Slavs emerged as a distinct linguistic and cultural group in Central/Eastern Europe much later, around the 5th-6th centuries AD. Their homeland is debated but was likely north of the Carpathian Mountains, in regions like present-day Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus—areas that were, centuries earlier, on the periphery of Scythian influence.
   * Genetic & Archaeological Consensus: There is no direct lineal descent of the Russian people from the Scythians. The ethnogenesis of the Russians is primarily from:
      * Early East Slavic tribes (like the Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs, Vyatichs).
      * Assimilation of Finno-Ugric tribes (indigenous populations of the North Russian forests).
      * A significant Scandinavian (Varangian) element among the ruling elite in the early Kyivan Rus' state (9th-11th centuries).
      * Later influences from Turkic, Baltic, and other groups.
Conclusion to Question #2: Alexander Blok's grounds were poetic and ideological, using the Scythian metaphor to express Russia's revolutionary, anti-Western, and Eurasian identity in 1918. Scientifically, the "true origin" of the Russians is not from the Scythians, but primarily from the later East Slavic tribes, with significant Finno-Ugric and Scandinavian components.

The Question:

"These two pictures illustrate the same legend about the origin of the Russian state. What caused furious disputes about the legend? What is the scientific reply to the question disputed?"

Inference from Context:

Since the pictures are not visible but are described as illustrating a legend about the origin of the Russian state, the legend is almost certainly the "Calling of the Varangians" (or the Normanist theory).

* The Legend: As recorded in the Russian Primary Chronicle (12th century), the Slavic and Finnic tribes of the Novgorod region, mired in internecine conflict, invited the Varangian (Scandinavian) chieftain Rurik and his brothers to rule over them in 862. Rurik established himself in Novgorod, founding the Rurikid dynasty, which ruled Kyivan Rus' and later Muscovy/Russia for over 700 years.

Detailed Answer

The Legend: The two pictures illustrate the foundational legend of the Russian state as recorded in the "Tale of Bygone Years" (The Russian Primary Chronicle), compiled in the 12th century. The legend is known as "The Calling of the Varangians" or the "Invitation to Rurik."

According to the Chronicle, in the year 862, the various Slavic (Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs) and Finno-Ugric (Chud, Ves, etc.) tribes in the region of Novgorod, tired of internal conflict and lacking order, decided to seek a ruler from abroad. They are quoted as saying, "Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us." They invited the Varangian (Scandinavian) chieftain Rurik and his brothers, Sineus and Truvor. Rurik settled in Novgorod (or Ladoga), founding the Rurikid Dynasty, which ruled Kievan Rus' and its successor states (including Muscovy and early Tsardom of Russia) until 1598.

1. What Caused the Furious Disputes About the Legend?

The disputes form the core of the "Normanist Question" (Normanist vs. Anti-Normanist Debate), which has been one of the most heated and politicized debates in Russian historiography for nearly 300 years. The fury stems from its implications for Russian national identity, origins, and political ideology.

* The Normanist Position (Origins in 18th Century German Historians): This view accepts the basic validity of the chronicle's account. It argues that the Scandinavians (Vikings/Varangians) were the decisive, organizing force in the creation of the first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus'. They point to:
   * The name "Rus" itself, which they derive from the Old Norse term "róðr" (a crew of oarsmen) or from "Ruotsi," the Finnish name for Sweden.
   * Archaeological evidence of significant Scandinavian presence in key trade centers like Staraya Ladoga, Novgorod, and Gnezdovo (near Smolensk) in the 9th-10th centuries.
   * The names of the first Rus' princes and ambassadors in Byzantine treaties, which are overwhelmingly Norse (e.g., Oleg = Helgi, Olga = Helga, Igor = Ingvar).
   * The testimony of contemporary foreign sources (Byzantine, Arab) that distinguish the "Rus" as a group separate from the Slavs.
* The Anti-Normanist Position (A Reaction with Nationalist & Political Dimensions): This view rejects the Chronicle's account as a later fabrication or misinterpretation. It argues that the Slavic state was an entirely indigenous development, and the Varangian role was minimal, mercenary, or mythical. The "furious" nature of the dispute arises because:
   * National Pride: The idea that the Russian state was founded by "foreigners" (Germans/Scandinavians) was seen as an insult to national dignity, especially from the 19th century onward as Romantic nationalism grew.
   * Soviet Ideology: Under Stalin, the Normanist theory was officially condemned as "bourgeois falsification" that denied the Slavic peoples' capacity for independent state formation—a key tenet of Marxist historical materialism. Anti-Normanism became state doctrine, and archaeologists/historians who argued for a significant Norse role faced severe persecution.
   * Modern Politics: The debate continues to resonate, with some modern Russian nationalists and "patriotic" historians strongly promoting Anti-Normanist views, seeing the Normanist theory as a Western plot to diminish Russia's historical stature.

In essence, the dispute is furious because it is not just an academic quarrel about archaeology, but a battle over the founding myth of the Russian nation: Was it created from within by the Slavic people, or catalyzed from without by Viking outsiders?

2. What is the Scientific Reply to the Question Disputed?

Modern scholarship, based on decades of interdisciplinary research (archaeology, linguistics, numismatics, comparative chronicle study), has moved beyond the rigid "either/or" dichotomy to a nuanced synthetic consensus. The scientific reply deconstructs the legend and provides a complex, evidence-based picture.

1. The Legend as Foundational Myth: Scholars agree the Chronicle story is a mythologized, later construction (written 300 years after the events) designed to:

* Give the ruling Rurikid dynasty a legitimate and prestigious foreign origin.
* Explain the name "Rus."
* Portray the founding of the state as a peaceful, legal contract, not a conquest.

2. The Consensus on Historical Reality:

* Indigenous Development: The region was not empty. Complex tribal societies of Slavs, Balts, and Finno-Ugric peoples existed, with their own social stratification, trade, and proto-urban centers (like the gorodishche near future Novgorod).
* The Crucial Role of Trade: The Volkhov-Dnieper river system ("The Route from the Varangians to the Greeks") was the economic engine. Control of this trade in furs, slaves, silver, and luxury goods generated the wealth and inter-tribal connections necessary for state formation.
* The Varangians as Catalyst and Elite: Here is the key synthesis: Scandinavian Vikings (Varangians) were not the "creators" of the Slavic people or their culture, but they became the dominant military-commercial elite that unified the pre-existing tribal structures under a new political framework. They were the armed traders and warriors who mastered the long-distance routes, established key fortified trading posts (emporia), and eventually took political control of them.
* The "Invitation" Trope: The concept of "inviting a ruler" is a common medieval literary trope to legitimize power. In reality, the process likely involved a combination of trade, mercenary service, conflict, and gradual assumption of power by a successful Varangian warlord (like the historical Rurik) and his retinue (druzhina).
* Rapid Assimilation: Critically, the Scandinavian elite was small. Within a generation or two, they had completely assimilated into the local Slavic majority, adopting their language, customs, and identity. By the time of Vladimir the Great (late 10th century), the rulers were culturally Slavic Orthodox princes, not Norse pagans.

Final Scientific Reply: The furious dispute is based on a false dichotomy. The modern scientific view holds that the origin of the Russian state was a complex process of internal socio-economic development among the Eastern Slavs, which was critically accelerated, unified, and politically led by a Scandinavian warrior-trading elite. The state of Kievan Rus' was born from the synergy between the Slavic-Finnic substrate and the Varangian superstrate. The legend of Rurik's calling preserves a kernel of truth about the foreign origin of its first dynasty, but not about the origin of the Russian people themselves.

Of course. Based on the provided screenshot, here are detailed explanations and answers for Questions 4 and 5. The facts have been cross-referenced with established historical scholarship.

The Image & The Scene:

The medieval-style illustration depicts Princess Olga of Kiev (c. 920–969), the ruler of Kievan Rus'. The specific scene illustrated is a famous episode from the Primary Chronicle describing her bloody revenge against the Drevlians, the tribe that killed her husband, Prince Igor.
"Why is the woman on the right taking a bath in the presence of the two men?"
Short Answer: She is not taking a bath. It is a trap, and she is having them burned alive.

Detailed Context: After executing several initial acts of revenge on the Drevlians, Olga promised to forgive them and asked for a show of honor. The Drevlians sent their best men to escort her. The chronicle then states: "Olga commanded that a bath be prepared for them, inviting them to wash after their long journey. When the men entered the bathhouse, Olga had it set on fire, and they were all burned to death." The illustration you see captures the moment the Drevlians enter the bathhouse before it is sealed and ignited. The two men are Drevlian ambassadors/nobles, and Olga is overseeing the execution of her elaborate scheme.

1."What differed her as a ruler from the preceding Russian dukes (princes)?"

Princess Olga is a monumental figure who differed from her predecessors (like Oleg, Igor, and her own husband) in two fundamental ways:
1. She was the first major female ruler. She ruled as regent for her young son, Sviatoslav, but exercised power with exceptional skill and authority, securing the state during a vulnerable transition.
2. She was the first Christian ruler of Kievan Rus' and a key civilizing reformer. While her predecessors were pagan warriors focused on conquest and tribute, Olga instituted a systematic, peaceful administration.

Administrative Reforms: She established a system of "pogosts" (administrative and trading centers) and standardized tribute collection, moving away from the chaotic, violent "poludie" (tribute-gathering tours) that got her husband killed.
Religious Significance: Baptized in Constantinople (c. 957), she became the first Christian in the Rus' ruling dynasty. Although she failed to convert her pagan son, her baptism planted the seed for the official Christianization of Rus' under her grandson, Vladimir the Great, in 988. For this, she is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church (Equal-to-the-Apostles).

Summary: She transitioned the ruler's role from a pagan warlord ("knyaz") to a Christian monarch focused on state-building, law, and diplomacy with the Byzantine Empire.

The Image & The City:
The reconstructed red-brick and wood fortress is part of the Kievan Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves) or the general fortifications of Kiev (Kyiv), the capital of modern Ukraine. The question confirms the city is Kiev.
"How did it happen that this city became the 'mother to the Russian cities'..."
The phrase "mother of Russian cities" is a direct translation from the Old East Slavic chronicles ("матерь городам русским"). Kiev earned this title because:
Political Capital: Under Prince Oleg (who moved there from Novgorod around 882), it became the capital of the Rurikid dynasty and the unified state of Kievan Rus'.
Religious & Cultural Center: After the Baptism of Rus' in 988 under Vladimir the Great, Kiev became the seat of the Metropolitan (the head of the Orthodox Church in the region). The magnificent Cathedral of Holy Wisdom (St. Sophia) and the Kiev Pechersk Lavra became centers of liturgy, art, literature, and law (e.g., Russkaya Pravda).
Source of Identity: For centuries, "Rus'" referred primarily to the land around Kiev. The shared Christian faith, dynastic rule, and culture that emanated from Kiev provided the foundational identity for the East Slavic peoples (the ancestors of modern Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians).
"...and how it found itself beyond the Russian borders?"
This refers to Kiev not being part of the modern state of the Russian Federation.

Historical Process:
Decline & Fragmentation (12th-13th centuries): After the death of Vladimir Monomakh, Kievan Rus' fragmented into rival principalities. The political and economic center began shifting north-east to Vladimir-Suzdal and later Moscow.
Mongol Destruction (1240): The Mongol invasion under Batu Khan sacked and devastated Kiev, breaking its power permanently.
Divergent Paths: The historical lands of Rus' developed under different dominions:
The north-east (including Moscow) evolved into the Tsardom of Russia.
The south-west (including Kiev) came under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Modern Borders: Kiev remained a central city for the Ukrainian people. After periods of Cossack autonomy and rule by the Russian Empire, the modern state of Ukraine was formed in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Kiev became the capital of the independent nation of Ukraine, thus placing it "beyond the borders" of the Russian Federation.

Conclusion: Kiev became the "mother of Russian cities" as the first political, religious, and cultural capital of the medieval East Slavic civilization, Kievan Rus'. It now lies outside Russia's borders due to the medieval fragmentation of that civilization, centuries of separate political development under Lithuanian/Polish rule, and the establishment of the modern independent state of Ukraine in the late 20th century.

The Subject:The monuments shown are dedicated to Yaroslav I, known as Yaroslav the Wise (Ярослав Мудрый) (c. 978–1054), Grand Prince of Kiev.

Answer and Explanation:

1. Why the Monuments are in These Specific Cities:
   * Kiev: As the capital, it was the seat of Yaroslav's power. His reign is considered the golden age of Kievan Rus'. The most famous monument to him stands near the Golden Gate, and his greatest architectural achievement, the Cathedral of Saint Sophia, is a UNESCO World Heritage site built under his rule.
   * Novgorod: Before ruling in Kiev, Yaroslav was the Prince of Novgorod. It was from here that he launched the campaign to claim the Kievan throne from his brother. He granted the city a degree of self-governance and a charter of laws, which strengthened its importance. A monument to him is part of the city's historical landscape.
   * Yaroslavl: This city is named after him. According to legend, he founded the city on the Volga River. Monuments to its founder are, therefore, central to the city's identity.
2. His Role in Russian History:Yaroslav the Wise was one of the most important rulers of Kievan Rus'. His role was transformative:
   * Consolidator of the State: He defeated his rivals and reunited the core lands of Rus', ending a period of fratricidal war. His long reign (1019–1054) brought internal stability.
   * Lawgiver: He oversaw the creation and codification of the first written Slavic law code, the "Russkaya Pravda" (Русская Правда, "Justice of Rus'"). This laid the legal foundation for the state for centuries.
   * Builder and Patron of Culture: He transformed Kiev into a major European capital, building the Saint Sophia Cathedral (rivaling Constantinople's Hagia Sophia), the Golden Gate, and monasteries. His court became a center for chronicle-writing, translation of Greek texts, and education.
   * International Statesman: He created a web of dynastic marriages linking Rus' to the royal houses of Europe (France, Hungary, Norway) and the Byzantine Empire, elevating Rus' to a major European power.

Conclusion for Q6: The monuments honor Yaroslav the Wise, the ruler who solidified Kievan Rus' as a stable, law-governed, Christian European power and a major center of culture and architecture.

# 7
The Subject:The text and monuments refer to Vladimir II Monomakh (Владимир Мономах) (1053–1125), Grand Prince of Kiev.

Answer and Explanation:

1. Identifying the Author from the Text:The provided text is a direct excerpt from Monomakh's most famous work, "The Instruction (or Testament) to My Children" (Поучение детям). It is a unique piece of medieval literature—part autobiography, part moral guide, and part political memoir written by a ruling prince for his sons.
   * The text describes a specific historical event: his conflict with Prince Oleg of Chernigov (his cousin) in 1076, where Monomakh chose to cede Chernigov to avoid further bloodshed among Christian Slavs, retreating to the smaller town of Pereslavl. His reflection, "I took pity on the souls of our Christian subjects...", is a hallmark of his writing, emphasizing piety, responsibility, and the avoidance of fratricidal strife.
2. His Role in Russian History:Vladimir Monomakh played a critical role during the beginning of Rus' fragmentation.
   * Last Unifier: He became Grand Prince of Kiev in 1113, not by the usual order of succession, but by popular acclaim of the Kievans to quell a rebellion. He was the last ruler to exercise substantial authority over the increasingly divided and rivalrous principalities of Kievan Rus'.
   * Lawmaker: He added new articles to the "Russkaya Pravda," regulating debts and the status of commoners, showing concern for social order.
   * Military Leader and Diplomat: He is most famous for organizing and leading a series of successful united campaigns against the Cumans (Polovtsians), the nomadic steppe people who constantly raided Rus' lands. His "Instruction" contains vivid accounts of these campaigns. He also used dynastic marriages to secure Rus' borders.
   * Cultural Figure: His "Instruction" is a priceless historical document and literary masterpiece, offering a rare personal voice from the period on rulership, faith, and ethics. It solidified his image as the ideal Christian prince—brave, pious, and wise.
3. The Monuments:The two statues (a bust and a seated figure) are common representations of Monomakh. He is often depicted as a thoughtful, bearded ruler, sometimes holding a cross or a scroll (symbolizing his "Instruction" or the law). Such monuments to him can be found in cities like Moscow (where he is considered a symbolic predecessor of the Muscovite tsars) and Chernigov.
Conclusion: The person is Vladimir Monomakh. His role was that of the last effective ruler of a united Kievan Rus', a famed military leader against the steppe nomads, a lawgiver, and the author of a seminal literary work that defined the ideals of princely rule in Russian culture.

# 8

The Region and the City:

* Region: The region indicated on the map is the North-East of Kievan Rus', specifically the interfluve of the Oka and Volga rivers. This area was the core of the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality.
* The City: The new city to which the center of power moved was Vladimir-on-Klyazma (Vladimir). While founded earlier, it became the political capital in the 12th century under Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky.

Explanation of the Shift in Power and Vladimir's Rise:

The shift of the political center from Kiev to Vladimir in the 12th century was caused by a combination of Kiev's decline and the North-East's strategic advantages.

1. Decline of Kiev (The "Push" Factors):

* Fragmentation & Dynastic Strife: The Kievan Rus' state fragmented into competing principalities after the reign of Vladimir Monomakh. Kiev was constantly fought over by rival branches of the Rurikid dynasty, weakening it through endless princely wars.
* Economic Decline: The Byzantine Empire's decline and the shifting of major Eurasian trade routes (like the Silk Road) away from the Dnieper River undermined Kiev's economic foundation.
* Nomadic Pressure: Constant raids by the Cumans (Polovtsians) on the southern steppe frontiers made the Kiev region increasingly dangerous and unstable, disrupting agriculture and trade.

2. Rise of Vladimir-Suzdal (The "Pull" Factors):

* Strategic Security: The North-East was protected by dense forests ("Zalessky Krai" - "Land beyond the forests"), which acted as a natural buffer against nomadic cavalry raids from the steppe.
* Economic Potential: It featured vast expanses of fertile land ("Opolye"), attracting settlers from the war-torn south. It had abundant resources (timber, furs) and controlled the headwaters of the Volga River trade route.
* Strong, Centralized Rule: Princes like Yuri Dolgoruky and especially his son Andrei Bogolyubsky pursued a policy of strengthening their personal, autocratic power, breaking the tradition of seniority and boyar (noble) councils that hampered Kiev. Andrei explicitly spurned Kiev, sacking it in 1169 and taking the title of Grand Prince to his own capital, Vladimir.
* Symbolic Legitimacy: To legitimize Vladimir as the new capital, Andrei and his successors embarked on a monumental building program. They constructed magnificent white-stone cathedrals (e.g., the Dormition Cathedral) and Golden Gates, rivaling and intended to surpass Kiev's splendor. They also promoted the veneration of a new national icon, the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God.

Conclusion for Q8: The center of power moved from Kiev to Vladimir in the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality because the North-East offered security, economic potential, and the opportunity for its princes to build a new, more centralized state, free from the internecine strife and external vulnerabilities that plagued Kiev.

# 9

The Two External Dangers of the Early 13th Century:

In the early 13th century, the Russian principalities faced a catastrophic existential threat from the East and a severe ideological-military threat from the North-West.

1. The Mongol Invasion (The Tatar-Mongol Yoke):
   * Who: The unified Mongol Empire under Batu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan.
   * When: The main invasion of the Rus' principalities occurred from 1237 to 1240.
   * Nature of the Danger: This was a war of conquest and subjugation. The Mongols employed total warfare, systematically destroying cities (like Ryazan, Vladimir, and Kiev), massacring populations, and dismantling existing political structures. Their goal was to make the Russian princes tributary vassals.
2. The Northern Crusades (Swedish and German Knights):
   * Who: Swedish forces and the German Teutonic Order and Order of the Sword Brothers (later merged as the Livonian Order).
   * When: A sustained campaign throughout the 13th century, with critical battles in the 1240s.
   * Nature of the Danger: This was a religious-political expansion. The Swedish and German orders, under the banner of the Papacy's Northern Crusades, sought to conquer and convert the Orthodox and pagan lands of Novgorod and Pskov. The danger was not just territorial loss but the enforced conversion of the population from Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism, threatening the core of Russian cultural identity.

How Russia Dealt with Them:

The response to these twin threats diverged dramatically, setting a historical course for centuries.

1. Response to the Mongols: Pragmatic Submission and Survival.
   * Military Resistance & Defeat: Initial resistance by individual principalities (like Vladimir) was heroic but futile. The Russian armies were defeated in detail due to a lack of unity and the Mongols' superior military tactics.
   * Acceptance of Vassalage: After the destruction, the surviving Russian princes, beginning with Yaroslav II of Vladimir in 1243, were forced to travel to the Mongol capital Sarai to receive a patent for rule ("yarlyk"). This meant acknowledging the Khan of the Golden Horde as their sovereign, paying heavy tribute (including a tax on individuals), and supplying troops.
   * Result: This established the "Tatar Yoke," a period of over 200 years of Mongol suzerainty. The Russian principalities retained their internal order and Orthodox faith but lost their sovereignty and were bled dry by tribute. This subjugation, while humiliating, allowed Russian statehood and culture to survive.
2. Response to the Western Crusaders: Military Defense and Symbolic Victory.
   * Unified Military Action: The Republic of Novgorod, which was largely spared by the Mongols due to its northern swampy lands, took the lead. It called upon its prince, Alexander Yaroslavich.
   * Alexander Nevsky's Campaigns: Prince Alexander decisively defeated the two invading forces:
      * Battle of the Neva (1240): He defeated a Swedish army, earning the epithet "Nevsky" ("of the Neva").
      * Battle on the Ice (Lake Peipus, 1242): He famously defeated the heavily armored knights of the Teutonic Order on the frozen lake, halting their eastward advance.
   * Result & Strategy: These victories stopped the Catholic German and Swedish expansion into Russian lands. Alexander Nevsky chose a policy of peaceful submission to the Mongols (seeing them as less of a threat to Russian identity, as they did not interfere with the Orthodox Church) in order to focus all resources on defending the western frontier. This policy was endorsed by the Orthodox Church and became foundational for future Muscovite strategy.

Conclusion for Q9: Russia faced annihilation from the Mongol Empire and conquest/conversion from the Western Crusaders. It dealt with the Mongols through pragmatic submission and vassalage to ensure survival, and with the Western threat through decisive military resistance led by Alexander Nevsky. This dual response preserved Orthodoxy and the Russian principalities, albeit under the long and oppressive Mongol Yoke.

Here are detailed, fact-checked answers for Questions 10 and 11, based on the provided descriptions.

# 10

The Name of the Russian Duke:

The duke depicted in both pictures is Alexander Yaroslavich, known as Alexander Nevsky (Александр Невский) (c. 1221–1263), Prince of Novgorod, Grand Prince of Kiev and Vladimir.

Explanation of the Pictures' Plots:

1. Left Picture (The Warrior on Horseback): This depicts Alexander Nevsky as a military commander and saint. The scene almost certainly represents his most famous victory: the Battle on the Ice (Ледовое побоище) on Lake Peipus in 1242, where he decisively defeated the crusading knights of the Teutonic Order. Alternatively, it could symbolize his earlier victory over the Swedes at the Battle of the Neva (1240), from which he earned the epithet "Nevsky" ("of the Neva"). The imagery emphasizes his role as the defender of the Russian lands from Western invaders.
2. Right Picture (The Ruler on the Throne): This depicts Alexander Nevsky as a statesman and loyal vassal. The scene likely shows him paying homage to or receiving a yarlyk (a patent to rule) from a Mongol Khan of the Golden Horde. After the Mongol conquest, Russian princes had to travel to the Horde's capital, Sarai, to pledge allegiance and be confirmed in their principalities. This image illustrates the other, more controversial pillar of Alexander's policy: pragmatic submission to the Mongol Empire to secure peace for his people and his own political authority.

Why was he advertised by Soviet propaganda in the late 1930s?

Soviet propaganda under Joseph Stalin resurrected and radically reshaped Alexander Nevsky's image in 1938 for specific, urgent political reasons tied to the pre-WWII climate:

1. Patriotic Mobilization: With the rising threat of Nazi Germany, Stalin needed a national Russian hero to rally the people, bypassing Communist internationalist ideology. Alexander Nevsky, as a legendary defender of the Motherland against foreign invaders, was perfect.
2. Anti-German Symbolism: The 1938 Sergei Eisenstein film Alexander Nevsky, with its iconic score by Prokofiev, was the centerpiece of this campaign. The film graphically depicted the Teutonic Knights as ruthless, fanatical invaders, creating a direct and powerful historical parallel to the contemporary Nazi threat. The film's famous quote, "Whoever comes to us with a sword, shall die by the sword," was a clear message to Germany.
3. Strategic Message: The propaganda highlighted only one side of his legacy—the defiant resistance to the West. It completely omitted his subservience to the Mongols. The message was clear: Russia must unite and fiercely resist the invasion from the West (Germany), while the government could pursue pragmatic diplomacy with the East (the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact of 1941 echoed this). His canonization by the Orthodox Church was downplayed, secularizing him into a purely national hero.

In summary: The pictures show Alexander Nevsky as both the defender against the West and the pragmatic vassal of the East. Soviet propaganda in the late 1930s exalted the first role to forge a nationalist, anti-German rallying point on the eve of World War II.

The City Marked by the Red Dot:

Based on the map's context ("Principality of Moscow" is labeled) and the historical question, the red dot almost certainly marks Moscow (Москва).

1. Its Name in the Early 13th Century:

In the early 13th century (specifically, at the time of the first written mention and before the Mongol invasion), it was a small fortified town on the Moskva River called Moscow. Its first mention in a chronicle is dated to 1147, when Prince Yuri Dolgoruky of Vladimir-Suzdal is said to have feasted there. There was no other name; it was simply the settlement of Moscow.

2. How it Became the Most Important Russian City by the End of the 13th Century:

Moscow's rise from a minor provincial outpost to the preeminent Russian city by 1300 was dramatic and resulted from a combination of shrewd politics, geography, and Mongol policy.

* Strategic Geography: Moscow was excellently located:
   * At the crossroads of important river trade routes (Moskva River connected the Volga and Oka basins).
   * In the relatively forested center of the Vladimir-Suzdal lands, offering protection from Mongol raids compared to more exposed cities like Vladimir or Kiev.
   * This attracted merchants, artisans, and peasants seeking safety, boosting its population and wealth.
* Shrewd, Long-Reigning Princes: The early princes of Moscow were ambitious and politically astute.
   * Daniel (1261-1303), the founder of the Moscow princely line and youngest son of Alexander Nevsky, is credited with initiating Moscow's expansion, seizing the key town of Kolomna.
   * The princes played the role of loyal, dependable servants to the Mongol Khans of the Golden Horde. They meticulously collected and delivered tribute, often using Mongol authority to undermine rival princes.
* The Key Factor: Mongol Patronage: This was the most critical element. The Mongols (Golden Horde) needed a reliable local ruler to act as their chief tax collector and enforcer among the Russian princes. The princes of Moscow proved ruthlessly efficient at this.
   * In 1328, Prince Ivan I (Ivan Kalita, "Moneybags") helped the Mongols crush a rebellion in Tver, Moscow's main rival. As a reward, the Mongol Khan granted him the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir and the exclusive right to collect tribute for the Horde from all Russian lands.
   * This made Moscow the de facto administrative and financial capital of Rus'. Ivan Kalita used the vast wealth from collected tribute to buy lands, loan money to other princes, and fortify Moscow with the first stone Kremlin (1339). He also persuaded the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Metropolitan, to move his seat from Vladimir to Moscow (c. 1326), making it the religious capital as well.

Conclusion for Q11: The city is Moscow. From a minor fort mentioned in 1147, it rose to supremacy by 1300 and solidified its status by 1340 due to its strategic location, the cunning and loyal service of its princes to the Mongol overlords, and the resulting roles as the primary tax collector for the Horde and, subsequently, the religious and political center of the Russian lands. Its rise was fundamentally tied to its subservient but exploitative relationship with the Mongol Empire.
Based on the screenshot you provided, here are detailed answers for Questions 12 and 13, continuing the format of thorough explanation and fact-checking.

The Episode Depicted:

The religious-style illustration depicts a church service, likely a liturgy or a prayer for divine intercession. The key detail indicated by the red circles is the specific gesture of blessing being used by the priest or bishop, and the focused, solemn atmosphere. Given the historical context of the questions in this exam (which have progressed through the 13th-14th centuries), this most likely represents a specific, famous moment: St. Sergius of Radonezh blessing Prince Dmitry Donskoy and his army before the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380.

Historical Significance of the Epoch:

This event belongs to the period of the "Moscow's Rise" and the initial, successful challenges to Mongol-Tatar authority in the late 14th century.

* The Event's Significance: Before facing the mighty army of the Golden Horde at Kulikovo Field, Prince Dmitry of Moscow sought the blessing of St. Sergius, the highly respected spiritual leader and founder of the Trinity Lavra monastery. St. Sergius not only blessed him but also predicted his victory, saying, "Go forth without fear, you will prevail." This blessing was crucial, as it framed the upcoming battle not merely as a political rebellion, but as a holy war for the Orthodox faith and the Russian land.
* The Epoch's Significance: This period (late 14th century) is defined by:
   1. The Weakening of the Golden Horde: It was experiencing internal strife (the "Great Troubles").
   2. The Consolidation of Moscow's Leadership: Moscow had grown strong enough under princes like Dmitry Donskoy to openly challenge its Mongol overlords for the first time.
   3. The Birth of National Consciousness: The struggle transformed from passive submission to an active, united military and spiritual resistance, with Moscow and the Russian Orthodox Church acting as the unifying forces. The blessing symbolizes this powerful church-state alliance that became central to Russian identity.

In summary: The image captures the spiritual preparation for the first major Russian victory over the Mongols. The epoch signifies the end of passive submission and the beginning of a conscious, unified struggle for independence, led by Moscow and blessed by the Church.

The Successful Episodes Against the Mongols Depicted:

The battle illustration shows Russian soldiers fighting steppe warriors. The two most significant, successful military episodes of the Russian struggle against the Golden Horde in this era are:

1. The Battle of Kulikovo Field (1380): Led by Prince Dmitry of Moscow (later "Donskoy")**, a coalition of Russian principalities inflicted a severe defeat on the forces of the Mongol warlord Mamai. This was the first major pitched battle where a Russian army defeated a Horde force of comparable size. It was a catastrophic defeat for Mamai, who was soon overthrown.
2. The Standoff at the Ugra River (1480): While not a bloody battle, this was a decisive strategic and political victory. The armies of Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscow and the army of Khan Ahmed of the Great Horde faced each other across the river for weeks. The Mongols eventually retreated without engaging in a major battle. This event is traditionally considered the end of the "Tatar Yoke," as Moscow formally ceased paying tribute and declared its full sovereignty.

Significance of the Epoch:

These events belong to the final stage of the "Moscow's Gathering of the Russian Lands" and the process of throwing off the Mongol Yoke (c. 1380-1480). This century-long epoch is one of the most critical in Russian history.

* Military-Political Significance: It marked the complete reversal of power dynamics. From being a submissive vassal, Moscow grew to become the independent, dominant power in the region. The victories proved the Horde was not invincible and that a unified Russian force could prevail.
* Psychological and National Significance: Kulikovo, in particular, was a massive psychological breakthrough. It gave the Russian principalities a sense of their own strength and a shared heroic narrative. It solidified Moscow's role as the defender of Rus' and the rightful center of the struggle for independence.
* State-Building Significance: The process culminated in 1480 with Ivan III's stand at the Ugra, which finalized Moscow's sovereignty. Freed from the tribute burden and with the prestige of being the "liberator," the Grand Principality of Moscow transformed into a sovereign, centralized Russian state, setting the stage for its declaration as a Tsardom in 1547.

In summary: The images represent the key victories at Kulikovo (1380) and/or the Ugra (1480). Their epoch signifies the century-long, successful struggle for independence from the Mongol Empire, which fundamentally created the conditions for the birth of the sovereign, centralized Russian state under Moscow's leadership.

Thank you for providing the detailed context from the image. Here are the comprehensive, fact-checked answers for Questions 14 and 15.

# 14

1. The Event Shown in the Pictures:

Based on the description of a "colorful" old town scene and a "black-and-white" crowd scene, and the logical progression of the exam (which has just covered the end of Mongol rule, c. 1480), the most likely event depicted is the end of the Time of Troubles (Смутное Время) and the election of Mikhail Romanov to the throne in 1613.

* The Colorful Image (ancient town scene): This likely depicts the Kremlin and Cathedral Square in Moscow during the early 17th century, potentially showing the moment the Zemsky Sobor (the national assembly) or the people acclaimed the new tsar. It represents the setting of the event.
* The Black-and-White Image (crowd): This is almost certainly a historical photograph or an artist's depiction of the great crowd of people, nobles, clergy, and commoners gathered in Moscow for the decision of the Zemsky Sobor or for the coronation. It represents the national participation in the event.

2. The Significance of the Epoch:

The event belongs to the epoch known as the "Time of Troubles" (1598-1613) and its immediate resolution. This period is one of the most critical and traumatic in Russian history, and the election of Mikhail Romanov is its defining conclusion.

* The Crisis of the Time of Troubles: This was a perfect storm of dynastic, social, and national catastrophes:
   1. Dynastic Collapse: The end of the ancient Rurikid dynasty (1598) and the failure of the subsequent Godunov and Shuisky rules led to a devastating power vacuum.
   2. Civil War & Imposter Pretenders: The era was defined by the horrific civil wars, peasant revolts, and the appearance of "False Dmitrys" (imposters claiming to be a deceased prince), which shattered social order.
   3. Foreign Invasion: The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden exploited the chaos, occupying Moscow (the Poles even held the Kremlin) and other key lands, threatening Russia's very sovereignty.
   4. State Collapse: Central authority dissolved, leading to famine, banditry, and the near-disintegration of the state.
* The Significance of the 1613 Event: The election of 16-year-old Mikhail Romanov by the Zemsky Sobor was significant because it:
   * Ended the Civil War: It provided a universally accepted, legitimate sovereign, finally ending the internal strife. Mikhail was a compromise candidate with ties to the old dynasty (his great-aunt was Anastasia, Ivan the Terrible's beloved first wife) and was not tainted by the betrayals of the Troubles.
   * Expelled Foreign Interference: It provided a national figurehead around which the patriotic forces, led by Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky, could fully consolidate to finally drive out the Polish and Swedish occupiers.
   * Founded the Romanov Dynasty: It established the Romanov dynasty, which would rule Russia for the next 304 years (1613-1917), overseeing its transformation into a major empire.
   * Birth of National Consciousness: The successful national mobilization against the invaders, coupled with the near-destruction of the state, forged a powerful new sense of Russian national and religious identity, centered on the defense of Orthodoxy and the autocracy that had saved it.

In summary: The pictures likely show the events surrounding the election of Mikhail Romanov in 1613. This event ended the catastrophic Time of Troubles, saved Russian sovereignty from foreign partition, and founded the Romanov dynasty, initiating a three-century period of recovery, consolidation, and imperial expansion.

1. The Subject of the Painting and the Replaced Name:

The painting is by Mikhail Klodt (nephew of the more famous sculptor Pyotr Klodt), created in 1884. Its full title is "The Last Spring" or, more descriptively, it illustrates a scene from Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy's dramatic poem "Prince Serebrenni".

* The Scene Depicted: The painting shows the ghost of a young woman, along with other spectral figures, appearing at the bedside of a sleeping man. The novel's context reveals this to be a moral reckoning. The ghosts are the victims of the man's cruelty.
* The Replaced Name ("?"): The man visited by the "ghosts of those murdered innocently" is Tsar Ivan IV Vasilyevich, known as Ivan the Terrible (Иван Грозный). The "?" in the list of Russian rulers (from Question 16's text) replaces his name.

2. The Role of His Rule in Russian History:

Ivan the Terrible's reign (1533-1584) was a pivotal, complex, and terrifying era that fundamentally shaped the Russian state.

* Early Reign (The "Good" Tsar): Initially, his rule was constructive. He was crowned as the first "Tsar of All Rus'" (1547), a title asserting imperial equality with the Holy Roman Emperor and the Mongol Khan. He convened the first Zemsky Sobor (national assembly), reformed the law code (Sudebnik of 1550), established a permanent professional army (streltsy), and oversaw the expansion of the state, notably the conquest of the Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan, which opened the Volga River and Siberia to Russian expansion.
* The Oprichnina and Terror (The "Terrible" Tsar): After the death of his beloved wife and due to mounting paranoia, he instituted the Oprichnina (1565-1572). This was a state-within-a-state: a separate territory under his direct control, administered by the oprichniki (a secret police/guard dressed in black, with dog's head and broom symbols, denoting they would "sniff out and sweep away" treason). The Oprichnina unleashed a decade of mass terror, torture, and executions against the old noble boyar class, the city of Novgorod (which was sacked and massacred), and anyone Ivan suspected of disloyalty. This period is the source of the ghosts in Klodt's painting.
* Contradictory Legacy:
   * Centralization of Power: His reign decisively broke the political power of the regional nobility (boyars) and established the absolute, autocratic power of the Tsar, setting the model for future rulers.
   * Disaster and Instability: The Oprichnina and the long, draining Livonian War (which ended in failure) devastated the economy, depopulated central regions, and created a social crisis. This instability is seen as a major contributing factor to the Time of Troubles that followed the extinction of his dynasty.
   * Cultural Patronage: Paradoxically, he also oversaw a cultural flowering, including the building of St. Basil's Cathedral on Red Square.

In summary: The painting by Klodt depicts the guilty conscience of Ivan the Terrible, haunted by his victims. His rule's role was profoundly dual: he created the centralized, autocratic Russian Tsardom through imperial expansion and legal reform, but he also nearly destroyed it through the paranoid terror of the Oprichnina, leaving a legacy of both imperial grandeur and profound state trauma that led directly to the catastrophic civil wars of the following century.

Excellent. Here are detailed, fact-checked answers for Questions 16 and 17, based on the provided slide and the established historical context.

1. The Name Replaced by "?":

The name that correctly belongs in the "?" position, between Tsar Fyodor I Ivanovich and False Dmitry I, is Boris Godunov (Борис Годунов).

2. The Role of His Rule in Russian History:

Boris Godunov's reign (1598-1605) is the critical, tragic link between the end of the ancient Rurikid dynasty and the catastrophic "Time of Troubles" (Смутное Время).

* Rise to Power: He was not a royal prince but a highly capable boyar and brother-in-law to the previous, weak Tsar, Fyodor I. During Fyodor's reign, Godunov was the de facto ruler, showing great administrative skill.
* Election as Tsar (1598): When the childless Fyodor I (the last son of Ivan the Terrible) died, the ancient Rurikid dynasty became extinct. The Zemsky Sobor (national assembly) elected Boris as Tsar. This was unprecedented: a tsar not by direct dynastic right, but by election and de facto merit. This break in the natural line of succession fatally undermined the new dynasty's legitimacy in the eyes of many aristocrats and the common people.
* His Reign as Tsar:
   * Ambitious & Modernizing Start: He was an intelligent and forward-looking ruler. He pursued diplomatic openings with Western Europe, imported foreign professionals, and even planned to establish schools and a university. His reign began with promise.
   * The Great Famine (1601-1603): A series of catastrophic crop failures led to a devastating, nationwide famine. Despite organizing relief efforts (selling grain from his own stores below market price), millions died, society collapsed into banditry, and Boris's popularity evaporated. The people saw this as divine punishment for a "usurper" tsar.
   * The Appearance of the First "False Dmitry": In 1603, a man claiming to be Tsarevich Dmitry, the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible (who had died under mysterious circumstances in 1591), appeared in Poland. This impostor, supported by Poles and disaffected Russians, claimed Boris had murdered the real Dmitry to seize the throne. The widespread willingness to believe this claim demonstrated the profound lack of legitimacy of the Godunov dynasty.
* His Role in History: Boris Godunov's rule represents the fragile and ill-fated attempt to establish a new, non-Rurikid dynasty. His personal abilities were undermined by natural disaster and, more importantly, by the deep-seated Russian tradition of hereditary succession. His death in 1605 opened the floodgates for the Time of Troubles—a period of civil war, foreign invasion, and a succession of more than a dozen claimants and impostors (as shown in the flowchart: False Dmitry I, then Vasily Shuisky). Thus, Boris is a pivotal figure: his reign was both the last period of stable rule before the chaos and, due to its contested legitimacy, the direct cause of that chaos.

1. The Connection Between the Two People:

* "Saint Prince Dmitriy": This refers to Saint Dmitry (Dmitri) Donskoy (1350-1389), the Grand Prince of Moscow and Vladimir. He is revered as a saint for his defense of the Russian lands and the Orthodox faith, most famously for his victory at the Battle of Kulikovo Field (1380) against the Mongols of the Golden Horde.
* "Dmetrius Emperor Moscoviae": This is a contemporaneous European portrait of False Dmitry I (reigned 1605-1606), an impostor who claimed to be Tsarevich Dmitry, the son of Ivan the Terrible. He seized the throne with Polish support during the Time of Troubles.

The Connection: The connection is in the name and the claim, but a total inversion in substance and historical meaning.

Both figures are named Dmitry (Dmitri). However, one is the genuine, canonized national hero, Prince Dmitry Donskoy, who defended Russia from foreign domination. The other is the archetypal impostor, False Dmitry I, whose fraudulent claim (to be a different Tsarevich Dmitry) ushered in a period of foreign invasion and national collapse. The exam question juxtaposes the "true" Dmitry, a symbol of unity and victory, with the "false" Dmitry, a symbol of deception, foreign intrigue, and state disintegration.

2. The Significance of the Epoch When Dmitry Donskoy Ruled:

Dmitry Donskoy's rule (1359-1389) marks the crucial turning point in the struggle for Russian independence from the Mongol Yoke and the rise of Moscow as the undisputed national leader.

* Consolidation of Moscow's Power: He successfully defended Moscow's leadership against rival principalities (like Tver) and the powerful Grand Duchy of Lithuania, cementing Moscow's role as the "gatherer of the Russian lands."
* The Battle of Kulikovo (1380): This is the defining event of his reign and one of the most significant in Russian history. For the first time, a united Russian army led by the Prince of Moscow, not as a rebel but as a national leader, inflicted a massive defeat on the Golden Horde's forces. Although the Horde reasserted control two years later, the myth of Mongol invincibility was shattered.
* Spiritual and National Significance: The battle was framed as a holy war for Orthodox Christianity against the Muslim Horde. The blessing of St. Sergius of Radonezh (from Question 12) was pivotal. Victory created a powerful new narrative: Moscow as the defender of the faith and the Russian people, the successor to Kiev, and the rightful political center. This solidified the alliance between the Moscow princes and the Orthodox Church.
* Legacy: While political independence would take another century to achieve (finalized in 1480 at the Standoff on the Ugra River), Kulikovo provided the psychological and moral foundation for that future independence. Dmitry Donskoy's reign transformed the principality of Moscow from a successful Mongol vassal into the acknowledged leader of the national liberation struggle. The epoch signifies the moment when the Russian lands, led by Moscow, stopped seeing themselves solely as victims and began to see themselves as potential victors.

In summary: The two Dmitrys are connected by name but represent polar opposites: the saintly unifier versus the fraudulent usurper. The epoch of the real Dmitry (Donskoy) is significant as the moment when Moscow-led Russia began its definitive, spiritually charged military and political struggle for independence from the Mongol Empire.

Based on the provided image, here are the detailed explanations and answers for Questions 18 and 19, continuing with the established historical context of the Time of Troubles.

# 18

1. Who of the two men is Minin, and who is Pozharsky?

The famous bronze monument on Red Square, in front of St. Basil's Cathedral, depicts the two national heroes of 1612. The identification is as follows:

* The man standing and gesturing with an outstretched arm is Kuzma Minin. He is a commoner, a Nizhny Novgorod merchant.
* The man seated, holding a large sword and a shield is Prince Dmitry Pozharsky. He is a Rurikid noble and a military commander.

Minin, the civilian, is shown in a dynamic pose, rallying the people and presenting Pozharsky, the military leader, with the sword of command. Pozharsky, though weakened from wounds, accepts the duty, symbolizing the union of the people and the nobility.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history when they did their famous deed?

Their famous deed was organizing and leading the National Militia (Народное ополчение) in 1611-1612, which liberated Moscow from the Polish-Lithish occupation. This act was the turning point of the Time of Troubles (Смутное время).

* The Context: By 1611, Russia was in a state of collapse. The Polish army occupied Moscow, a Polish prince was claiming the throne, and Sweden had seized Novgorod. There was no legitimate tsar, and the state had disintegrated.
* Their Achievement: In Nizhny Novgorod, the merchant Kuzma Minin initiated a patriotic movement, collecting funds and rallying the people. He insisted that Prince Dmitry Pozharsky, a respected military commander, lead the army. Together, they formed a united force of nobles, townspeople, Cossacks, and peasants. After fierce fighting, their militia stormed Moscow's Kitai-gorod and liberated the Kremlin from Polish forces in October 1612.
* Historical Significance: This victory made it possible to reconvene the Zemsky Sobor (national assembly), which, freed from foreign pressure, could elect a new tsar. In 1613, they chose Mikhail Romanov, founding the Romanov dynasty. Therefore, the epoch is significant as the moment of national resurrection. It demonstrated the possibility of unity across social classes to save the homeland, ended the period of foreign intervention, and created the conditions for the restoration of a legitimate, sovereign Russian state. The monument symbolizes this unity and patriotic sacrifice.

# 19

1. What is the role of Feodor Chaliapin (on the photo) in this play?

The play is not a play but an opera: "A Life for the Tsar" (Жизнь за царя), also known as "Ivan Susanin", composed by Mikhail Glinka (premiered in 1836). It is the foundational work of Russian classical music.

Feodor Chaliapin (Шаляпин) was the greatest Russian operatic bass of the 20th century. While he was famously associated with the title role in Modest Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, he was also renowned for his powerful portrayal of Ivan Susanin, the central protagonist of Glinka's opera. Therefore, in this opera, Chaliapin would have performed the title role of the peasant hero, Ivan Susanin.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history which is presented in the play?

The opera is set in the exact same epoch as the deeds of Minin and Pozharsky: the end of the Time of Troubles, specifically in 1613.

* The Plot: The story is based on a (likely legendary) historical episode. A Polish military detachment searches for the newly elected, young Tsar Mikhail Romanov to capture or kill him. They force a peasant from the Romanov estate, Ivan Susanin, to guide them. Susanin deliberately leads the Polish troops deep into an impenetrable forest, sacrificing his own life. His deed allows the tsar to reach safety, securing the future of the dynasty and the state.
* Historical & Ideological Significance: The epoch depicted is, once again, the final, pivotal crisis of the Time of Troubles. The opera's significance lies in how it interprets this history for the 19th-century Russian Empire:
   1. National Myth-Making: It transforms the historical narrative into a powerful national myth. The peasant Susanin becomes the ultimate symbol of loyalty, self-sacrifice, and the unbreakable bond between the common people and the divinely-ordained tsar.
   2. Unity of All Estates: Just as the Minin/Pozharsky monument shows noble and commoner united, the opera shows the peasantry's crucial role in saving the monarchy. It presents an ideal of national unity across social strata (the sobornost concept).
   3. Legitimization of the Romanovs: By glorifying the sacrifice that ensured Mikhail Romanov's safety, the opera powerfully legitimizes the ruling Romanov dynasty, suggesting its rule was won and preserved by the people's love and sacrifice.

In summary: Chaliapin played the heroic peasant Ivan Susanin. The opera depicts the same critical epoch (1612-1613) as Question 18, but its significance lies in its 19th-century function: to create a potent national founding myth that celebrated autocracy, popular piety, and the sacred union between the tsar and his people, using the story of the Time of Troubles as its foundational drama.

Here are detailed, fact-checked answers for Questions 20 and 21, based on the provided image and context.

# 20

1. The Social and Political Movement:

The social and political movement that initiated the "dispute on the faith" depicted in Vasily Perov's painting is the Raskol (Раскол), known in English as the Great Schism or Old Believers' Schism, within the Russian Orthodox Church.

2. The Epoch and Its Role in Russian History:

* The Epoch: The Schism began in the mid-17th century, precisely during the reign of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich (1645-1676) and under the patriarchate of Patriarch Nikon (1652-1666). This period is often seen as the transition from medieval Muscovy to the early Russian Empire.
* What Happened: Patriarch Nikon, with the Tsar's support, instituted a series of reforms to correct Russian liturgical books and rituals (e.g., the spelling of Jesus, the number of fingers used to make the sign of the cross, the direction of processions) to align them with contemporary Greek Orthodox practices. His goal was to assert Moscow's role as the center of Orthodox Christianity ("the Third Rome") by ensuring its practices were the most correct and universal.
* The Resulting Dispute: These changes were violently opposed by a significant portion of the clergy and laity, led by figures like the archpriest Avvakum. They saw the reforms as a corruption of the true, ancient Russian faith that had saved Holy Rus'. The dispute was not about minor ritual details but about the very essence of Russian identity: was it the guardian of unique, sacred traditions, or was it to submit to external (Greek) authority for the sake of a universal Orthodox polity?
* The Role of the Epoch in Russian History:
   1. Profound Religious and Social Split: The state church anathematized the "Old Believers" (or "Old Ritualists"), leading to a brutal persecution that lasted for centuries. The Raskol created a permanent, large, and persecuted minority within Russian society, fracturing its religious unity.
   2. Crisis of Authority and "The Third Rome" Ideology: The Schism shattered the previously unshakeable unity between the people, the church, and the state. The idea of Moscow as the "Third Rome"—the last bastion of true faith—was undermined when the state itself was seen as betraying that faith. This created a deep cultural trauma and a legacy of popular suspicion toward state-imposed reform.
   3. Precursor to Peter the Great's Reforms: The state's brutal suppression of the Old Believers demonstrated its willingness to use absolute power to break traditional society for its own modernizing goals. In this sense, Nikon's reforms were a dress rehearsal for the much more radical, secular Westernization that Peter the Great would impose from above just a few decades later. The epoch established a pattern of top-down transformation met with popular resistance.

In summary: The painting depicts the Raskol (Great Schism). This epoch of the mid-17th century was pivotal because it created a deep, lasting fracture in Russian society and the church, demonstrated the increasing power of the autocratic state over spiritual life, and set the stage for the even more transformative reign of Peter the Great.

# 21

1. The City and Its Purpose:

* The City: The city poetized by Alexander Pushkin in the provided lines (from his narrative poem "The Bronze Horseman") is Saint Petersburg (Санкт-Петербург). The lines describe the Neva River, the city's ornate railings, its pensive nights, and the Admiralty spire.
* Why It Was Created: St. Petersburg was founded by Tsar Peter the Great in 1703 with a clear, radical purpose: to be a "window to Europe" (окно в Европу).
   1. Strategic & Military: To secure Russia's access to the Baltic Sea, which he had just won from Sweden in the Great Northern War, and to establish a modern naval base and port.
   2. Political & Cultural: To create a new, modern capital that would break decisively with the old, "Asiatic" traditions of Moscow. It was to be a symbol of the new, Europeanized, rational, and secular Russia that Peter was building. It was a city built from scratch by decree, using Western European architecture and urban planning, intended to be Russia's gateway to Western science, technology, and culture.

2. The Significance of the Epoch:

The epoch during which St. Petersburg came into existence is the reign of Peter the Great (1682-1725), particularly the period after his Grand Embassy to Europe (1697-98) and his victory in the Great Northern War (1700-1721). This epoch is one of the most significant in all of Russian history.

* A Forced Revolution from Above: Peter's reign was not mere reform; it was a cultural revolution designed to forcibly drag Russia into the ranks of the great European powers. This involved:
   * Modernization of the State and Army: He created a modern, professional standing army and navy, a new bureaucratic apparatus (the Table of Ranks), and subordinated the church to the state (abolishing the Patriarchate, creating the Holy Synod).
   * Cultural Westernization: He forced the nobility to shave beards, wear European clothes, adopt social manners, and seek education. He promoted science, founded the first Russian museum and public newspaper, and simplified the Cyrillic alphabet.
   * Economic and Industrial Push: He developed mining, manufacturing, and trade, often using state control and serf labor.
* Dual Legacy and the "Petersburg Period": The founding of St. Petersburg encapsulates Peter's entire project and its dual legacy:
   1. The Rise of an Empire: His victory over Sweden made Russia the dominant power in the Baltic. In 1721, he was proclaimed Emperor (Император), and Russia was officially renamed the Russian Empire. The epoch marks Russia's definitive arrival as a major European imperial power.
   2. A Profound National Schism: The building of St. Petersburg on the swamps of the Neva, at a colossal human cost (thousands of serfs died), became a powerful symbol. For some, it was a glorious capital of progress (as in Pushkin's line "I love thee, city of Peter's making"). For others, it was an unnatural, alien city imposed on the Russian landscape, symbolizing the state's violent rupture with the national past (a theme Pushkin also explores in "The Bronze Horseman"). The epoch thus cemented a lasting tension in Russian identity between Westernizing modernization and nativist tradition.

In summary: The city is Saint Petersburg, created as a "window to Europe" and a symbol of a new, modern Russia. Its founding epoch under Peter the Great marks Russia's transformation into a secular, bureaucratic, European-style empire, a process that was monumental in its achievements but also profoundly traumatic, creating a cultural divide that would define Russian intellectual and political life for centuries.

# 22

1. Which Russian ruler is depicted in this picture?

The ruler depicted is Peter I Alexeyevich, known as Peter the Great (Пётр I Великий) (1672-1725).

2. What changed in Russia during his reign, and what is the role of that epoch?

Peter the Great's reign (1682-1725, with sole rule from 1696) was a period of revolutionary transformation that altered every aspect of the Russian state and society. The painting of him at a shipyard perfectly symbolizes the core of his reforms.

* Fundamental Changes:
   * Military & Statehood: He created a modern, professional standing army and navy (the Baltic Fleet, as shown in the painting) from scratch, which allowed Russia to defeat the Swedish Empire in the Great Northern War (1700-1721). In 1721, he was proclaimed Emperor (Император), and Russia was renamed the Russian Empire.
   * Administrative Modernization: He dismantled the old boyar Duma and created a new, European-style bureaucratic system (the Governing Senate, Colleges) and the Table of Ranks, which tied noble status to state service rather than just birth.
   * Cultural Westernization: He forcibly Europeanized the Russian elite: beards were taxed, Western clothing was mandated, and new forms of social life (assemblies) were introduced. He promoted secular education, founded the Russian Academy of Sciences, and simplified the Cyrillic alphabet.
   * Economic & Industrial Policy: He aggressively developed mining, manufacturing, and trade, often using state capital and serf labor, to support his military ambitions. This is directly linked to figures like Nikita Demidov (Question 23).
   * Symbolic Geography: He founded a new capital, Saint Petersburg (1703), on the Baltic coast as a "window to Europe," physically turning Russia towards the West and away from its Moscow-centered past.
* The Role of the Epoch:This epoch marks the definitive break between medieval Muscovy and the modern Russian Empire. Peter's reign is the pivotal "revolution from above" that thrust Russia into the European state system as a major power. Its role is dual:
   1. It established the foundations of Russia's imperial greatness, its modern state institutions, and its military might.
   2. It created a profound and lasting cultural schism between a Westernized elite and the traditional masses, and established the model of autocratic power using coercive means to modernize society—a pattern that would echo for centuries. The epoch is, therefore, the birthplace of both imperial Russia and its central historical tensions.

# 23

1. What is Nikita Demidov famous for?

Nikita Demidovich Antufyev, better known as Nikita Demidov (1656-1725), was a Tula blacksmith and weapons manufacturer who became the founding patriarch of the Demidov family, Russia's most powerful and wealthy industrial dynasty in the 18th-19th centuries. He is famous for:

* Establishing the foundation of the Ural mining and metallurgical empire. He used his skill and entrepreneurship to fulfill Peter the Great's colossal orders for weapons, especially for the army and navy during the Great Northern War.
* Building numerous state-of-the-art iron and copper plants in the Urals, which became the primary industrial base for Russia, supplying metal for military hardware, cannons, and later for civilian use. His factories were crucial to Russia's victory over Sweden and its rise as a great power.

2. Why is this monument erected in one of the Urals cities?

The monument is in the Urals because that region was the heartland of the Demidov industrial empire. Cities like Nizhny Tagil and Yekaterinburg were essentially founded and built by the Demidovs around their plants. Erecting a monument there honors the man (and the dynasty) that transformed the Urals from a remote frontier into the industrial backbone of the Russian Empire.

3. Who is the second man on the monument, and why is he present?

The second man, seated on a higher pedestal, dressed in simpler attire, is almost certainly Tsar Peter the Great.

4. What is his role in Russian history, and why is he present here?

Peter the Great's role is detailed above. He is present on the monument with Demidov to symbolize their historic partnership. Their relationship epitomizes Peter's entire modernization project:

* The Patron and the Visionary: Peter provided the vision, the demand, and the resources (land, serfs, mineral rights) needed for rapid industrialization.
* The Entrepreneur and the Executor: Demidov provided the practical skill, managerial genius, and drive to realize Peter's vision on an unprecedented scale.The monument commemorates the alliance between the autocratic state and entrepreneurial talent that powered Russia's transformation. Peter recognized and nurtured Demidov's talent, and Demidov, in turn, became one of the chief engines of Peter's ambition. Together, they represent the force that built imperial Russia's industrial and military might.

Of course. Here are the detailed explanations and answers for Questions 24 and 25, based on the provided text and historical context.

1. The Allusion in the Anthem:

The first Russian national anthem, "Гром победы, раздавайся!" ("Let the Thunder of Victory Rumble!"), was written by Gavrila Derzhavin in 1791. The key allusion in the provided line—"We have shaken Mahomet!"—is a direct and triumphant reference to the Russo-Turkish Wars and, more specifically, to the recent Russian victory over the Ottoman Empire.

* "Mahomet" is an archaic Western rendering of the name of the Prophet Muhammad. Here, it functions as a metonym, standing for the entire Ottoman Empire and its Islamic faith, which was the primary geopolitical and religious antagonist of Orthodox Russia for centuries.
* The verb "shaken" (потрясать) refers to the decisive military blows that shattered Ottoman power. The most immediate and glorious event alluded to is the storming and capture of the fortress of Izmail in December 1790 by the legendary Russian commander Alexander Suvorov. This victory was the climax of the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1791 and sent shockwaves through Europe, demonstrating the overwhelming power of the reformed Russian army.

2. Significance of the Epoch:

This anthem was born during the reign of Catherine the Great (Catherine II, 1762-1796). This epoch, known as the "Golden Age of the Russian Nobility," is profoundly significant for several reasons:

* Imperial Expansion & Military Triumph: Catherine's reign marked the most successful period of territorial expansion in Russian history. Following the wars with the Ottoman Empire and the partitions of Poland, Russia secured the entire northern coast of the Black Sea (New Russia, Crimea), finally achieving the centuries-old dream of a "warm-water port." The anthem celebrates this era of aggressive, confident imperialism where Russia defeated its ancient foe and was recognized as a leading European great power.
* The Rise of Russian National Consciousness: Prior to this period, Russian high culture largely imitated French and German models. Derzhavin's anthem, along with the works of other contemporaries, represents the birth of a distinctive, self-confident Russian national culture. The anthem is not a translation or an adaptation of a foreign tune; it is an original Russian poem celebrating a specifically Russian victory, set to a popular tune. It symbolizes the empire finding its own voice.
* The Paradox of Enlightenment: Catherine corresponded with Enlightenment philosophers like Voltaire and presented herself as an "enlightened monarch." However, this epoch of external glory and cultural flowering was built upon the intensification of serfdom and the absolute power of the autocracy. The anthem, therefore, embodies the confident, militaristic, and expansionist face of her rule, which dazzled Europe while suppressing internal dissent (as seen in the crushing of the Pugachev Rebellion, 1773-75).

In summary: The allusion is to Russia's victory over the Ottoman Empire ("Mahomet"), specifically the capture of Izmail. The epoch of Catherine the Great is significant as the era of Russia's triumphant emergence as a Black Sea and European imperial power and the simultaneous flowering of a self-aware national culture.

1. The Identity of "She":

In the satirical poem by Alexey Konstantinovich Tolstoy (from his mock-history "History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev"), the "she" who argues with her ministers and says in French, "Messieurs, vous me comblez" ("Gentlemen, you overwhelm/flatter me"), is Catherine the Great.

2. The Significance of the Described Epoch:

The poem's fragment satirizes a central event and contradiction of Catherine's reign: the question of serfdom and the limits of her "enlightened" rule.

* The Historical Context: Upon ascending the throne, Catherine posed as a reformer. In 1767, she convened a Legislative Commission to draft a new law code. Liberal delegates, inspired by Enlightenment ideas, actually proposed discussing the improvement of the serfs' condition. The poem satirizes this moment: Catherine's ministers ("Famusov" is a character from Griboyedov's play, used here generically for a conservative noble) flatter her by suggesting she is a "mother" to the people who could "give them freedom." Catherine's coy, flirtatious reply in French (the language of the aristocratic elite) is a refusal disguised as modesty. In reality, she quickly shut down any discussion of serfdom after the Pugachev Rebellion (1773-75), fearing noble discontent, and subsequently granted the nobility even greater power over their serfs.
* Significance of the Epoch:This episode highlights the fundamental hypocrisy and tragedy of Catherine's "enlightened absolutism."
   1. The Height of Serfdom: Despite the Enlightenment ideals she professed, Catherine's reign saw serfdom reach its most oppressive and extensive form, legally and in practice. Serfs were transformed into outright chattel, could be bought and sold separately from land, and had no recourse against owner cruelty.
   2. The Great Divide: The epoch cemented the unbridgeable gap between the Westernized, French-speaking aristocracy and the Russian peasantry. The state was an alliance between the autocrat and the nobility, built on the exploitation of the serfs. Tolstoy's satire exposes how the language of reform was just a fashionable mask for maintaining a brutal, exploitative system.
   3. The Birth of the Critical Intelligentsia: While the 18th century saw the birth of national pride, the 19th century (when Tolstoy was writing) saw the rise of a critical intelligentsia. Writers like Tolstoy used historical satire to critique the roots of contemporary social ills. By mocking Catherine's failure to act on serfdom, he is criticizing the very foundations of the old regime, highlighting a national sin that would eventually demand a violent reckoning.

In summary: The "she" is Catherine the Great, being flattered as a potential liberator of the serfs—a role she famously refused. The epoch is significant as the apogee of serfdom and "enlightened" hypocrisy, where imperial glory abroad was built upon the intensified enslavement of the population at home, creating the social contradiction that would define 19th-century Russian history.

1. The Historical Event Referenced by the "Fire" in the Poem:

The "fire" mentioned in the dialogue between the characters Famusov, Skalozub, and Chatsky from Alexander Griboyedov's play "Woe from Wit" (Горе от ума) is a direct reference to the Great Moscow Fire of 1812.

* Context in the Play: In the cited scene, Colonel Skalozub makes a callous joke: "I received some news pleasant for me: the fire contributed much to decorating it" ("Пожар способствовал ей много к украшенью"). He is referring to the rebuilding of Moscow after the fire. Famusov agrees, lamenting the pre-fire city's chaotic layout. The progressive Chatsky reacts with horror to their cynical conversation about a national tragedy.
* The Historical Event: This fire was the catastrophic burning of Moscow in September 1812, which occurred as the Russian army and most of the population abandoned the city to Napoleon's invading Grande Armée. The fire raged for nearly a week, destroying roughly three-quarters of the city. While its exact cause remains debated (deliberate Russian sabotage, accidental looting, or French negligence), it became a symbol of scorched-earth tactics and national sacrifice.

2. The Role of that Event in Russian History:

The Fire of Moscow and the larger Patriotic War of 1812 in which it occurred played a transformative role in Russian history.

* Military and Geopolitical Turning Point: The fire deprived Napoleon's army of shelter and supplies on the eve of the harsh Russian winter. This catastrophe, coupled with the Russian army's strategic maneuvering, forced Napoleon's disastrous retreat, which destroyed his army. This victory propelled Russia to the apex of the Congress of Vienna (1814-15), establishing it as the supreme continental European power and "gendarme of Europe."
* Birth of Modern Russian Nationalism: The war was framed not just as a state conflict but as a "Patriotic" (Отечественная) war for the survival of the nation. The collective sacrifice, including the burning of Moscow, forged a powerful, modern national consciousness that crossed class lines, at least temporarily.
* The "Decembrist" Paradox and Intellectual Awakening: This is the core irony Griboyedov highlights. The victorious young Russian officers (like the play's Chatsky) who pursued Napoleon to Paris were exposed to Western ideas of constitutionalism and civil liberty. Returning to a victorious but still autocratic and serf-owning Russia, they were bitterly disillusioned. The fire, for them, symbolized not just a patriotic trial but the old, stagnant Russia that needed to be cleansed and rebuilt. This intellectual ferment directly led to the Decembrist Uprising of 1825. Thus, the event that cemented Russia's external glory simultaneously planted the seeds of its first modern revolutionary movement against the autocracy.

In summary: The fire is the Moscow Fire of 1812. Its role was monumental: it was the catalyst for Napoleon's defeat, elevating Russia to peak European power while simultaneously igniting a national identity and the intellectual discontent that would challenge the autocratic system from within.

1. The Identity of the People in the Picture:

The people shown in the painting "Execution of 1826" are the five executed leaders of the Decembrist Uprising: Pavel Pestel, Sergei Muravyov-Apostol, Konstantin Ryleyev, Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin, and Pyotr Kakhovsky.

* They were noblemen, guards officers, and intellectuals who led the failed revolt on December 14, 1825.
* They were sentenced to death by quartering, a punishment later commuted by Tsar Nicholas I to hanging.

2. The Significance of the Epoch This Event Concludes:

The execution concludes the epoch of the Decembrist Movement and the Uprising of 1825, an event of foundational importance for modern Russian history.

* The First Revolutionary Challenge: The Decembrist Uprising was the first open, armed rebellion against autocracy in Russian history, planned and led not by peasants but by the most privileged elite—the aristocracy and military officers. Its goal was to establish a constitutional monarchy or a republic and abolish serfdom.
* The End of Liberal Aristocratic Reformism: The brutal suppression and executions marked the definitive end of any hope for reform "from above" initiated by the enlightened nobility. Tsar Nicholas I, traumatized by the revolt, embarked on a 30-year reign (1825-1855) of extreme conservatism, embodied in the state ideology of "Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality." He created the Third Section, a secret political police, to suppress all dissent.
* The Birth of the Russian Intelligentsia and Revolutionary Tradition: Although defeated, the Decembrists became eternal martyrs and heroes for all subsequent opposition movements. Their sacrifice created the model of the selfless revolutionary intellectual devoted to the people. They proved that the struggle against autocracy was possible, inspiring future generations of radicals from Alexander Herzen to the Bolsheviks. The epoch, therefore, represents the irreparable rupture between the state and the educated society, setting the course for a century of underground revolutionary struggle.

In summary: The painting shows the executed Decembrist leaders. This event concludes the epoch of the 1825 Uprising, which is significant as the origin point of Russia's revolutionary tradition and the moment the state chose ruthless repression over reform, locking the country into a fatal confrontation between autocracy and the intelligentsia.

1. Who is cutting the bear's claws?The claws of the bear (representing Russia) in the Black Sea are being cut by the coalition of the Ottoman Empire, Great Britain, France, and the Kingdom of Sardinia during the Crimean War (1853-1856). The cartoon specifically references the Allied (primarily British and French) naval and military campaign that besieged and captured the Russian naval base at Sevastopol in Crimea, effectively neutering Russia's Black Sea Fleet—hence "cutting the bear's claws."
2. Title of the war:The Crimean War (known in Russia as the "Eastern War").
3. Role in Russian history:The Crimean War was a watershed moment that exposed critical weaknesses in the Russian Empire and forced a period of intense introspection and reform.
   * Exposed Systemic Backwardness: The war revealed Russia's profound technological, logistical, and administrative inferiority compared to France and Britain. Its industrial base, railway network, and military medicine were hopelessly outdated.
   * Geopolitical Humiliation: Russia's defeat was formalized in the 1856 Treaty of Paris. The empire was forced to demilitarize the Black Sea, losing its right to maintain a fleet or coastal fortifications—a massive blow to its strategic position and prestige.
   * Catalyst for the "Great Reforms": The shock of defeat convinced the new Tsar, Alexander II, that the empire could not survive without modernization. This directly led to the most significant reform in 19th-century Russia: the Emancipation of the Serfs in 1861, followed by modernizing reforms in the judiciary, military, and local government. Thus, the war's primary role was to shatter the conservative complacency of the Nicholas I era and force Russia onto the painful path of top-down modernization.

# 29

1. The social phenomenon depicted:The painting "The Governess Has Arrived" ("Дворник и барыни" is sometimes also known by this title, though it literally means "The Yardman and the Ladies") by Vasily Perov (created 1866) masterfully captures the profoundly ambiguous and tense social reality in the aftermath of the 1861 Emancipation of the Serfs.
   * It shows a former serf (the yardman or governess), now legally free, interacting with his former masters (the "ladies").
   * The scene is fraught with unresolved social hierarchy and economic dependency. While the servant is no longer owned, he likely remains economically bound to the household. The body language, the servant's deferential yet isolated stance outside the door, and the ladies' postures convey a relationship caught between the old world of master and serf and the new, uncertain world of employer and employee. It illustrates that legal emancipation did not erase deep-seated social attitudes or immediately solve the problem of economic survival for the freed peasants.
2. Significance of the depicted epoch:The epoch is the era of the "Great Reforms" under Alexander II (reigned 1855-1881), initiated by the Emancipation.
   * An Incomplete Modernization: This was an era of monumental, yet fundamentally flawed, transformation. Serfdom was abolished, but peasants were often left with inadequate land and burdened with heavy redemption payments. The painting visualizes the resulting paradox: a "free" individual still trapped in a web of old dependencies and social disdain.
   * The Seedbed of Future Revolutions: The reforms created heightened expectations for further change. When these expectations were frustrated by the limits of the reforms themselves, it led to disillusionment among the intelligentsia and the educated public. This discontent fueled the rise of the populist (narodnik) movement** and, eventually, more radical revolutionary ideologies. The epoch, therefore, did not create stability but released new social forces and political aspirations that the autocratic state would prove increasingly unable to manage, setting the stage for the revolutionary crises of the early 20th century. Perov's painting is a critical document of this pivotal, contradictory, and ultimately destabilizing period in Russian history.

1. The connecting item in the picture:

The item in the painting that connects both Dmitri Mendeleev and Alfred Nobel is the tablecloth (скатерть) on the table around which the figures are gathered.

* For Mendeleev, the connection is legendary. The story goes that the concept for the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements came to him in a dream, where he saw the elements arranged in order of atomic weight on a kind of grid or... a table. This metaphorical "table" is often visually linked to the idea of a tablecloth.
* For Alfred Nobel, the connection is material. His most famous and financially successful invention was dynamite. The key to stabilizing the volatile nitroglycerin was to absorb it in a porous, solid material. The substance Nobel famously used was kieselguhr (diatomaceous earth), a soft, sedimentary rock. In a symbolic sense, this absorbent, cloth-like mineral substrate that made his explosive safe to handle can be abstractly associated with the functional idea of a cloth or mat—a tablecloth.

Therefore, the "tablecloth" symbolizes the foundational concept for Mendeleev (the Periodic Table) and the foundational material for Nobel's practical explosive.

2. The significance of their epoch:

Mendeleev (published his table in 1869) and Nobel (patented dynamite in 1867) achieved their fame in the late 19th century, during the reign of Alexander II and Alexander III. This epoch holds immense significance for Russia:

* The Age of Science and Industry: This was the period of the Second Industrial Revolution. Russia, driven by the reforms of Alexander II, was undergoing rapid, if uneven, modernization. Mendeleev's work provided the theoretical framework for modern chemistry, essential for industrial development. Nobel's explosives were crucial for mining, railway construction, and major engineering projects that were transforming the Russian landscape.
* Russian Entry into World Science: Mendeleev's achievement was a watershed moment. It marked the first time a Russian scientist had formulated a fundamental, universal law of natural science. It signaled Russia's arrival as a contributor to global scientific thought, moving beyond simply importing Western knowledge.
* The Central Paradox: This scientific and industrial progress occurred within a deepening social and political crisis. While minds like Mendeleev's reached for universal order, the autocratic state was becoming more conservative and repressive after Alexander II's assassination (1881). The tools of progress (science, industry, explosives) also became tools of both state control and revolutionary terror. The epoch, therefore, was one of brilliant intellectual achievement set against a backdrop of growing societal strain, foreshadowing the coming revolutionary explosions of the 20th century.

1. Why "Revolution," not "Revolt"?

The events of 1905-1907 are termed a "Revolution" (as in the book titles) and not merely a "Revolt" or "Rebellion" because they constituted a nationwide, systemic political and social crisis that fundamentally challenged the legitimacy of the autocracy and created alternative centers of power. Key characteristics that justify the term "revolution" include:

* Mass, National Scale: It was not a local uprising. It involved a general strike that paralyzed the entire country, peasant revolts across the empire, mutinies in the military (most famously on the battleship Potemkin), and unrest among national minorities.
* Political Organization and New Institutions: The revolution spontaneously generated a novel political organ: the St. Petersburg Soviet (Council) of Workers' Deputies. This was a proto-governmental body that represented a direct, democratic challenge to the Tsarist state's authority.
* Constitutional Outcome: It forced the regime to make a fundamental political concession. The October Manifesto (1905), issued by Tsar Nicholas II, granted basic civil liberties and established the State Duma, Russia's first nationally elected legislative body. This transformed Russia from an absolute autocracy into a semi-constitutional monarchy, however reluctantly and imperfectly.

A "revolt" implies an armed rebellion aimed at seizing power locally or expressing grievance. A "revolution" implies a broader societal convulsion that alters the political system's very foundations, which is what occurred between 1905 and 1907.

2. The significance of the 1905-1907 epoch:

The First Russian Revolution is arguably the most important event in Russian history between the emancipation of the serfs (1861) and the revolutions of 1917. Its significance is multifaceted:

* The "Dress Rehearsal" for 1917: Vladimir Lenin famously called it the "dress rehearsal" for the Bolshevik Revolution. It was the first time all the major social forces (industrial workers, peasants, the military, liberal bourgeoisie, and radical intelligentsia) acted simultaneously against the autocracy. It tested strategies, revealed the regime's vulnerabilities, and trained a generation of revolutionaries.
* The End of Unchallenged Autocracy: The autocracy's sacred, unassailable authority was shattered. By being forced to grant a constitution and a Duma, the Tsar admitted that his power was no longer derived solely from God, but required at least a semblance of popular sanction. This irrevocably broke the political spell of absolutism.
* Revealing the Regime's Strategy: The regime's response set a fateful pattern: making tactical concessions (the Duma) while simultaneously using violent repression and later rolling back those concessions. This strategy disillusioned moderates and convinced radicals that peaceful, constitutional change was impossible under the Romanovs.
* Unresolved Contradictions: Crucially, the revolution failed to solve the core issues that caused it: land hunger among peasants, poor working conditions, and the lack of genuine popular sovereignty. The peasantry did not receive enough land, and the Duma's power was severely limited. Thus, the revolution did not bring stability but deepened the political divisions and stored up social energy for an even greater explosion.

In summary, the 1905 Revolution was the pivotal event that ended the era of unmodified Tsarist autocracy, introduced mass politics to Russia, demonstrated the power of the working class, and, by failing to address root causes, made the larger revolution of 1917 all but inevitable.

Here are detailed, fact-checked answers for Questions 32 and 33, based on the provided image descriptions and historical context.

1. The war illustrated by the photo:

The photo depicts Austrian prisoners of war in Russia, which directly points to World War I (1914-1918). Russia fought as part of the Allied Powers (the Entente) against the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary. The photo was taken by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky, a pioneer of color photography who documented the Russian Empire, including its home front during the war.

2. The role it played in Russian history:

World War I was the cataclysmic event that destroyed the Russian Empire and led directly to the revolutions of 1917.

* The Final Crisis of Tsarism: The war placed an unbearable strain on Russian society. Massive casualties (millions dead, wounded, or captured, as seen in the photo), economic collapse, rampant inflation, and severe food shortages in cities destroyed public confidence in the government of Tsar Nicholas II.
* Undermining of Authority: Nicholas II's decision to take personal command of the army in 1915 tied the fate of the monarchy directly to the failing war effort. The government's incompetence and the influence of the mystic Grigori Rasputin over the Tsarina further discredited the regime.
* The Catalyst for Revolution: The direct result of the war's strains was the February Revolution of 1917, which began with bread riots in Petrograd and led to Nicholas II's abdication and the end of the Romanov dynasty. The Provisional Government that followed chose to continue the war, a fatal decision that eroded its own support and paved the way for the Bolsheviks, who promised "Peace, Land, and Bread."
* Birth of the Soviet State: The Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution (1917) and immediately signed the punitive Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918), taking Russia out of the war at a enormous territorial cost. The war, therefore, created the precise conditions of chaos, despair, and military collapse that allowed Lenin's party to succeed.

In summary: The photo illustrates World War I. Its role was that of the final, decisive stressor that shattered the political, social, and economic foundations of Tsarist Russia, leading to its collapse and creating the vacuum that the Bolshevik Revolution filled.

# 33

1. Correct chronological order of the photos:

The correct order, from earliest to latest figure in terms of their primary political activity and impact, is:

1. Pyotr Stolypin (Left photo: the man with the distinctive mustache). He served as Prime Minister of the Russian Empire from 1906 until his assassination in 1911.
2. Vladimir Lenin (Middle photo: the iconic portrait). He was the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917 and ruled the nascent Soviet state until his death in 1924.
3. Joseph Stalin (Right photo: the younger man in a military-style tunic). He emerged as the supreme leader of the Soviet Union in the late 1920s after a power struggle following Lenin's death, ruling until his own death in 1953.

2. Significance of the epoch illustrated:

These three figures collectively represent the most tumultuous and transformative epoch in modern Russian history: the final crisis of the Empire, the Revolution, and the formation of the totalitarian Soviet state (c. 1906-1953).

* Stolypin (Era of Last-Ditch Reform & Repression): His tenure represents the Tsarist regime's last, desperate attempt at conservative modernization without political liberalization. He is known for two things: 1) Brutal repression of revolutionaries ("Stolypin's necktie" – the noose) following the 1905 Revolution, and 2) A major agrarian reform aimed at creating a class of independent, prosperous peasant landowners (kulaks) to serve as a pillar of stability for the monarchy. His era was one of "calm" enforced by the gallows, combined with a failed gamble to reform the economic base while keeping the autocratic political system intact.
* Lenin (Era of Revolutionary Seizure and Civil War): Lenin's era marks the violent overthrow of the old order and the establishment of a new, ideological state. The significance is foundational: he led the Bolshevik coup, won the ensuing Civil War (1918-1922), and established the dictatorship of the Communist Party, the Cheka (secret police), and the principle of a state-run, command economy (War Communism, later the New Economic Policy). His actions created the world's first communist state and a model for revolutionary parties globally.
* Stalin (Era of Totalitarian Consolidation and Terror): Stalin's rule represents the completion of the Soviet system as a totalitarian empire. The significance of his epoch is defined by: 1) The forced, brutal industrialization of the USSR via the Five-Year Plans; 2) The forced collectivization of agriculture, which destroyed the peasantry Stolypin had tried to create and caused famines; 3) The Great Terror of the 1930s, which physically eliminated all real and perceived opposition within the party and society; and 4) Leading the USSR to victory in World War II, which solidified its status as a superpower but at a colossal human cost. His rule entrenched a system of personal dictatorship, ideological conformity, and state terror that defined the Soviet Union for decades.

In summary: The sequence Stolypin → Lenin → Stalin illustrates the epoch of Russia's passage from a decaying empire attempting reform, through a radical socialist revolution, to the solidified, terrifying power of a totalitarian superpower. It is the story of the 20th century's most dramatic political transformation.

Based on the image you provided, here are the correct answers to questions #34 and #35.

# 34

1. Do these posters agitate for the Bolsheviks or against them?

These posters agitate against the Bolsheviks. They are examples of White Army (anti-Bolshevik) propaganda from the Russian Civil War.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history which is illustrated by the posters?

The posters illustrate the Russian Civil War (1917-1922/23). This was a pivotal epoch with the following significance:

* Existential Conflict: It was a brutal, multi-sided war to determine Russia's political future after the 1917 Revolutions—whether it would be a communist state, a restored monarchy, or another form of government.
* Ideological Battle: The era was defined by intense propaganda warfare. The Bolsheviks (Reds) fought against a loose coalition of monarchists, republicans, nationalists, and foreign allies (the Whites).
* Poster Messages: The specific posters attack core Bolshevik policies:
   * The left poster ("All the land and factories – to the landowners and capitalists!") condemns Bolshevik nationalization of property, promising a return to the old social order.
   * The right poster ("For the united Russia!") appeals to patriotism and tradition (using the symbol of Saint George), contrasting with the Bolsheviks' revolutionary internationalism and the fragmentation of the old empire.

# 35

What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history which is illustrated by the posters?

The poster illustrates the New Economic Policy (NEP), introduced in 1921.

The significance of this epoch is:

* Major Policy Reversal: It marked a decisive end to the policy of "War Communism" (1918-1921), which involved the forcible seizure of all agricultural surplus from peasants, leading to widespread famine and rebellion.
* Strategic Retreat: The NEP was a pragmatic, temporary retreat from full communism to revive the collapsed economy. It reintroduced a limited market economy.
* The "Food Tax": As the poster shows, the state replaced grain requisitioning with a fixed tax in kind. Peasants knew exactly what they owed (the portion for the city) and could keep or freely sell their surplus (the portions for exchange and the family). This incentive aimed to restore agricultural production and ease tensions with the peasant majority.
* Foundation for Recovery: The NEP succeeded in stabilizing the economy and allowed the war-torn Soviet state to recover, setting the stage for the debates and industrial drives of the late 1920s.

Based on the image and text you provided, here are the answers for questions #36 and #37.

# 36

1. Which poster depicts kolkhozniki (collective farm workers)?

The poster that depicts kolkhozniki is Poster C (the third one from the left in the set of four). It shows agricultural workers operating tractors in a field, which is the classic visual symbol of the mechanized collective farm (kolkhoz) during the Stalinist era.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history which is illustrated by the poster?

The poster illustrates the period of Stalinist Collectivization and Industrialization (late 1920s-1930s).

* Policy: This era was defined by the First Five-Year Plan (1928-1932) and the forced collectivization of agriculture. Peasant farms were violently merged into large, state-controlled collective farms (kolkhozes).
* Significance: This was a second, radical revolution from above with profound consequences:
   1. Economic Transformation: Its goal was to modernize agriculture through mechanization (as shown by the tractors) and to extract grain and resources from the countryside to fund rapid heavy industrialization.
   2. Social Catastrophe: It destroyed the traditional peasant way of life. Resistance was met with deportation or execution. The policy led directly to the catastrophic man-made famine of 1932-33 (Holodomor), particularly in Ukraine, killing millions.
   3. Political Consolidation: It completed Stalin's consolidation of power, establishing total state control over the entire economy and society.

# 37

1. What is the idea behind the poster?

The idea behind the poster "Ускорим промфинплан!" ("Uskorim promfinplan!" – "Let's Accelerate the Industrial-Financial Plan!") is to promote super-productivity and over-fulfillment of state economic plans.

* It visually glorifies the Stakhanovite movement, where individual workers (like the miner Alexey Stakhanov) were celebrated for dramatically exceeding production quotas.
* The poster's message is one of enthusiastic competition and labor heroism. It urges workers to pour their zeal and effort into the plan, personifying the plan itself as a figure being propelled forward by their collective labor. The goal was to inspire other workers to follow suit and boost overall industrial output.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history which is illustrated by the poster?

The poster belongs to the era of the Second and Third Five-Year Plans (1933-1941).

* Context: This period followed the brutal collectivization drive. The focus shifted intensely to maximizing industrial output and meeting (or exceeding) planned quotas.
* Significance:
   1. Mobilization of Society: The state used propaganda, incentive systems, and immense social pressure to mobilize the entire population for industrial goals. The Stakhanovite movement was a key tool in this mobilization.
   2. Building "Socialism in One Country": This frenetic industrial push was meant to prove the superiority of the Soviet system and rapidly build a self-sufficient industrial and military power, which Stalin deemed necessary for survival in a hostile world.
   3. Preparation for War: The massive industrialization, particularly in heavy industry and defense, was crucial in preparing the USSR for the coming total war with Nazi Germany (The Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945).
 
Based on the screenshot and text you provided, here are the answers to questions #38 and #39.

# 38

1. What was the reason for death?

The reason for the death of all these people in 1937 was execution (or death in the Gulag camp system) as part of Joseph Stalin's "Great Purge," officially known as the Yezhovshchina or the Great Terror.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history to which this event belongs?

This event belongs to the period of the Great Purge (1936-1938), the peak of political repression under Stalin.

* Purpose & Scale: It was a campaign of mass arrests, show trials, imprisonments, and executions designed to eliminate all perceived enemies of the state, both real and imagined. It targeted not only high-ranking political and military figures (like those pictured) but also intellectuals, artists, and ordinary citizens.
* Significance:
   1. Consolidation of Total Power: It was the final step in Stalin's absolute consolidation of power, utterly destroying any potential opposition within the Communist Party, the government, and the Red Army.
   2. Climate of Terror: It created a pervasive atmosphere of fear and paranoia that ensured complete obedience and suppressed dissent throughout Soviet society for decades.
   3. Historical Trauma: The Purge deeply scarred the Soviet Union, decimating its military leadership on the eve of World War II and leaving a lasting legacy of state violence and silenced memory.

(Note: While the exact map is not fully visible, the repeated label "Lake Ladoga" and the context of surrounding questions strongly indicate it depicts a WWII battle near Leningrad.)

1. Events of what year are illustrated by this map?

The map most likely illustrates the events of 1941, specifically the start of the Siege of Leningrad (also known as the Leningrad Blockade).

2. What is the significance of that epoch of the Russian history which is illustrated by the map?

The map illustrates the Great Patriotic War (1941-1945), the Soviet Union's conflict with Nazi Germany during World War II.

* The Specific Event (Siege of Leningrad): Beginning in September 1941, German and Finnish forces encircled the city of Leningrad. The siege lasted for 872 days, becoming one of the longest and most destructive blockades in history.
* Significance:
   1. Extreme Suffering & Resilience: The blockade led to catastrophic famine and the deaths of over 1 million civilians, primarily from starvation. The survival of the city became a powerful symbol of Soviet and Russian resilience and sacrifice.
   2. Strategic "Road of Life": Lake Ladoga, as shown on the map, was crucial. During winter, an ice road ("The Road of Life") was built across its frozen surface, providing the only supply line and evacuation route for the besieged city. This highlights the desperate and ingenious measures taken for survival.
   3. Pivotal Theater of WWII: The Eastern Front, where this siege occurred, was the largest and bloodiest theater of World War II. The war's immense cost and ultimate victory became a central pillar of Soviet and later Russian national identity.

Based on the new image you provided, here are the answers for questions #40 and #41.

# 40

1. What is the name of the city?

The city on the map is Ленинград (Leningrad), which is present-day Saint Petersburg.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history which is illustrated by the map?

The map illustrates a crucial phase of Великая Отечественная война (The Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945), specifically the Siege of Leningrad.

* The Event: The map shows German forces (in blue) encircling the city, cutting it off by land, with Lake Ladoga to the east. This depicts the beginning of the nearly 900-day siege, one of the longest and most destructive in history.
* Significance:
   1. Symbol of Suffering and Resilience: The blockade led to extreme famine and the deaths of over a million civilians. The city's survival became a supreme symbol of Soviet resistance and endurance.
   2. Strategic "Road of Life": Lake Ladoga, visible on the map, became the city's lifeline. In winter, a supply route (the "Road of Life") was established over the ice, and in summer, supplies came by boat. This highlights the desperate struggle for survival.
   3. Pivotal Eastern Front: The defense of Leningrad tied down massive German forces and was a key strategic failure for the Nazi war machine. The war on this front was the largest and most brutal theater of World War II, fundamentally shaping the modern history of Russia and Europe.

1. What is the idea behind the posters?

The posters are both powerful examples of Soviet home front mobilization propaganda during the Great Patriotic War, targeting different segments of the population with specific calls to action.

* Left Poster ("We Shall Replace!" / "ЗАМЕНИМ!"):
   * Idea: It calls on Soviet women to join the industrial workforce to replace the men who have gone to the front. The determined female worker in front of industrial imagery represents the critical role of women in keeping factories running and the war economy going.
* Right Poster ("The enemy will not escape revenge of people!" / "ОТ НАРОДНОЙ МЕСТИ! НЕ УЙТИ ВРАГУ!"):
   * Idea: It calls for total people's war and partisan resistance, even among the elderly in occupied territories. The armed older peasant couple symbolizes that every citizen, regardless of age, must become a defender and an avenger against the invading enemy.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history which is illustrated by the posters?

The posters belong to the period of the Great Patriotic War (1941-1945).

* Context: Following the initial shock of the German invasion, the Soviet state mobilized its entire society for a "war of annihilation."
* Significance:
   1. Total Mobilization: The war effort required the complete dedication of the population. Propaganda like this was essential to motivate civilians—women, the elderly, teenagers—to undertake extreme sacrifices in factories, fields, and behind enemy lines.
   2. Unity and Sacrifice: These posters promoted a message of national unity, collective sacrifice, and righteous vengeance, which were central themes in sustaining morale during the war's immense hardships.
   3. Foundation of Victory: The unprecedented mobilization of human resources depicted in these posters was a fundamental factor in the Soviet Union's eventual victory, achieved at a staggering human cost.
 
Of course. Here are the answers for questions 42 and 43, based on the provided image and text.

# 42

1. Explain the change in the names at the Red Square Mausoleum: why and when did it occur?

The change occurred in 1961. Stalin's name was removed from the mausoleum, leaving only Lenin's. This was a direct, public consequence of the policy of "de-Stalinization" initiated by Nikita Khrushchev.

* Why: Khrushchev denounced Stalin's crimes—including the Great Purges, forced collectivization's famine, and his cult of personality—in his "Secret Speech" at the 20th Party Congress in 1956. Removing Stalin's body from the mausoleum (it was later buried by the Kremlin Wall) and his name from it was the ultimate symbolic act of repudiating his legacy and consolidating Khrushchev's political reforms.

2. What did it mean for the Russian (Soviet) people?

For the Soviet people, this was a profoundly shocking and confusing event that forced a painful national reckoning.

* It meant the official, public shattering of the god-like image of Stalin, who had been presented as the infallible "Father of Nations" and victorious wartime leader for decades.
* It opened a period of uncertainty and trauma, as people had to reconcile the official narrative of a criminal tyrant with their own memories, grief, and sacrifices made in his name. It represented a fragile "thaw" in political and cultural life, but one filled with anxiety about the past.

3. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history to which this event belongs?

This event belongs to the Khrushchev Thaw (mid-1950s to mid-1960s).

* Significance: This era marked a decisive, though incomplete, break with the most extreme terror of Stalinism. It involved:
   1. De-Stalinization: The systematic criticism of Stalin's rule, the release of millions from Gulag camps, and a relaxation of state terror.
   2. The "Thaw": A limited cultural and intellectual liberalization, with slightly more freedom for artists and writers.
   3. Political Limits: The process was controlled from above. The core structures of the one-party state and centrally planned economy remained intact, and criticism of the Communist Party itself or of Lenin was still forbidden. The removal of Stalin's name from the mausoleum perfectly symbolizes this controlled, partial reform.

# 43

1. What event is mocked by the caricature?

The caricature mocks the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, the 13-day confrontation between the United States (President John F. Kennedy) and the Soviet Union (Premier Nikita Khrushchev) that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

* How it mocks it: The cartoon depicts Khrushchev and Kennedy in an "arm-wrestling" match, but they are sitting on a giant nuclear missile instead of a table. This satirizes the crisis as a reckless, macho game of brinkmanship between the two superpowers, where the "prize" for losing was global annihilation. It reduces the high-stakes geopolitical confrontation to a childish yet deadly contest of wills.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of the Russian history to which this event belongs?

This event belongs to the peak period of the Cold War, specifically the era of heightened tension and direct superpower confrontation in the early 1960s.

* Significance: The Cuban Missile Crisis was the single most dangerous moment of the Cold War and a pivotal turning point.
   1. Brink of Nuclear War: It demonstrated how close the world came to catastrophe due to miscalculation and posturing.
   2. Shift in Soviet Strategy: The crisis ended in a public compromise (Soviet missiles removed from Cuba in exchange for a secret U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba and the later removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey). This perceived humiliation for Khrushchev contributed to his ouster in 1964 and led to a Soviet drive for nuclear parity with the U.S., rather than risky gambles.
   3. Détente: The shared terror of the crisis led to the establishment of a direct communication hotline between Washington and Moscow and, eventually, to a period of détente (easing of tensions) and arms control talks in the following decade. The cartoon captures the reckless pre-détente mindset it helped to end.

Based on the image and text you provided, here are the answers for questions #44 and #45.

# 44

1. Tell about the reform promoted by the posters.

The posters promote the economic reforms of Perestroika ("Restructuring") initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev in the mid-to-late 1980s. Specifically, they address the concepts of "Khozraschyot" (economic accounting) and self-financing.

* Left Poster ("Be Strong in Economics!" / "Khozyaystvuy Umelo!"): This poster encourages skillful, efficient management. The giant hand on the abacus symbolizes the new requirement for factories and enterprises to carefully account for costs, reduce waste, and be financially self-sufficient, moving away from the old system of guaranteed state funding regardless of performance.
* Right Poster ("This is what the lazy one has got..." / "Zarplata" (Wage)): This poster promotes the direct link between worker productivity and pay. It criticizes laziness and absenteeism, showing that under the new reforms, wages would be tied to the actual results and efficiency of the worker and the enterprise, not just guaranteed.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of the Russian history to which this reform belongs?

This reform belongs to the period of Perestroika and Glasnost (mid-1980s to 1991), the final years of the Soviet Union.

* Goal of Reform: The reforms aimed to revitalize the stagnant, centrally-planned Soviet economy by introducing elements of market-style accountability, incentive, and limited decentralization without abandoning socialism.
* Significance of the Epoch:
   1. Systemic Crisis: The need for such posters admitting to laziness and poor management highlighted the deep-seated economic problems and low productivity ("zastoy" or stagnation) of the Brezhnev era.
   2. Contradiction and Failure: While the intent was to modernize socialism, Perestroika inadvertently exposed the system's fundamental flaws. The half-measures often led to shortages, confusion, and economic decline rather than renewal.
   3. Unintended Consequences: The economic reforms, coupled with the political openness of Glasnost, unleashed forces (nationalist aspirations, public criticism, loss of control) that the Communist Party could not contain. This epoch is significant as the period of the collapse of the Soviet Union and its entire economic and political system.

1. Prove the Nobel Committee decision by the facts.

The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 "for the leading role he played in the radical changes in East-West relations." This decision is supported by key factual policies he initiated:

* Ending the Cold War: Gorbachev renounced the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had justified Soviet military intervention in Eastern Europe. This allowed the peaceful, revolutionary transformations of 1989.
* Arms Control: He signed groundbreaking treaties with the U.S., most notably the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty (1987), which eliminated an entire class of nuclear missiles.
* Withdrawal from Afghanistan: He ordered the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Afghan War (completed 1989), ending a costly and unpopular conflict.
* German Reunification: He agreed to the reunification of Germany and its membership in NATO, a monumental concession that effectively ended the post-war division of Europe.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of the Russian history to which this event belongs?

This event belongs to the final stage of Perestroika and the immediate dissolution of the Soviet Union (1990-1991).

* Significance:
   1. End of the Cold War: Gorbachev's foreign policy was the primary catalyst for ending the decades-long geopolitical and ideological confrontation that had defined the second half of the 20th century. The Nobel Prize recognized this monumental achievement.
   2. Paradox of Leadership: The award highlights the central paradox of the era: Gorbachev was celebrated globally as a peacemaker and reformer, while domestically he was increasingly blamed for the Soviet Union's loss of superpower status, economic chaos, and impending collapse.
   3. Transition to a New World Order: This epoch marks the definitive end of the bipolar world. The award symbolizes the West's embrace of Gorbachev's "new thinking" in foreign policy, which replaced confrontation with cooperation, paving the way for the post-Cold War era. Domestically, it occurred amidst the terminal crisis of the USSR, which would formally dissolve in December 1991.

Answer Regarding the Nobel Prize Slide (Mikhail Gorbachev)

1. Prove the Nobel Committee decision by the facts.

The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 "for the leading role he played in the radical changes in East-West relations." Key facts supporting this decision include:

* Ending the Arms Race: He signed the groundbreaking Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty (1987) with the U.S., eliminating an entire class of nuclear missiles.
* Renouncing the Brezhnev Doctrine: This policy shift allowed for the peaceful revolutions in Eastern Europe in 1989 without Soviet military intervention, leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall.
* Withdrawal from Afghanistan: He ordered the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops (completed 1989), ending a costly and unpopular war.
* German Reunification: He agreed to a reunified Germany within NATO, effectively ending the Cold War division of Europe.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of Russian history to which this event belongs?

This event belongs to the final stage of Perestroika and the dissolution of the Soviet Union (late 1980s-1991).

* Significance: Gorbachev's foreign policy, recognized by the prize, was the primary catalyst for ending the Cold War. Domestically, it highlighted the paradox of his rule: he was celebrated globally as a peacemaker while being blamed at home for the USSR's loss of superpower status and the ensuing political and economic chaos that led to its collapse in 1991.

1. What is common and what is different between these two cases?

Common: Both photos show tanks on the streets of Moscow in the early 1990s, symbolizing extreme political crises where constitutional order broke down and military force was used to resolve a power struggle.

Different:

* Left Photo (August 1991): Depicts the failed hardline coup against Soviet President Gorbachev. Boris Yeltsin (standing on the tank) famously defied the plotters, casting himself and the tank crews as defenders of democracy against a regressive putsch. This event accelerated the USSR's dissolution.
* Right Photo (October 1993): Shows the climax of the constitutional crisis between President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian parliament. Here, Yeltsin ordered tanks to shell the White House (parliament building) to crush his opponents. Yeltsin was now using the army to attack a democratically elected legislature.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of the Russian history to which these events belong?

This epoch marks the chaotic and violent birth of the post-Soviet Russian state (1991-1993).

* Significance: These events demonstrated the fragility of new democratic institutions. The 1993 crisis concluded with Yeltsin's victory and a new constitution that established a super-presidential system, concentrating power in the executive branch and shaping Russia's political system to this day. The period is remembered as one of lawlessness, violent political conflict, and traumatic transition.

1. Explain the ideas of the caricatures dated 1992-1993.

These cartoons are a satirical critique of the "shock therapy" economic reforms implemented by Yeltsin's government, led by Acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar.

* Left Cartoon: A reformer (likely representing the government) says on the phone, "Now you understand, Yegor, what it is - a breakthrough in the economic reform." This sarcastically portrays the government's perspective, touting the painful measures as a historic "breakthrough."
* Right Cartoon: It depicts the brutal reality for ordinary people. The word "Yegor" is a pun, as it sounds like the Russian word for price ("tsena"). The items—chocolate, washing powder, a sack of potatoes—all have the label "Yegor" (price). A skeleton cries "Help! Shock Therapy!" This illustrates the main consequence of "shock therapy": hyperinflation. Prices skyrocketed, wiping out savings and plunging millions into poverty, while basic goods became unaffordable.

2. What is the significance of that epoch of the Russian history to which they belong?

They belong to the period of radical economic "shock therapy" and the formation of wild capitalism in Russia (1992-1993).

* Significance: This was the traumatic initial phase of Russia's transition to a market economy. The reforms, involving price liberalization and privatization, caused immense social hardship. This era created a deep public disillusionment with Western-style liberal reforms and contributed to the rise of powerful oligarchs, shaping a lasting negative perception of the 1990s as a time of chaos and poverty for many Russians.
