The Question:"What grounds did Alexander Block have to write the following expression? What is the true origin of the Russians?"
The Provided Text:
The text is an excerpt from the poem "The Scythians" (Скифы) written by Alexander Blok in 1918.
* Russian Excerpt: The provided Cyrillic text contains several errors (e.g., "ягодыни охлани" is a severe distortion of the correct line "жадными очами"). The correct final two lines are: "Да, скифы — мы! Да, азиаты — мы, / С раскосыми и жадными очами!"* English Translation: The provided English translation is interpretive and takes significant liberties. A more standard, literal translation is: "Yes, we are Scythians! Yes, we are Asiatics, / With slanted and greedy eyes!"

Answer and Explanation:

1. Alexander Blok's "Grounds" (Historical & Ideological Context):
   * The Poem's Moment: Blok wrote "The Scythians" in January 1918, immediately after the Bolsheviks dissolved the Russian Constituent Assembly. This was a moment of immense turmoil, with World War I ongoing and the Russian Civil War beginning. The poem is addressed to the "Old World" of Europe.
   * The "Scythian" Myth: Blok is using a powerful historical metaphor. The Scythians were ancient nomadic tribes of the Eurasian steppes, often portrayed in classical Greek history as the archetypal "barbarian" other—fierce, uncivilized, and a constant threat to the settled, "civilized" West.
   * Blok's Message: Blok identifies revolutionary Russia with these Scythians. His "grounds" are not genetic or anthropological but cultural-political and metaphysical. He is arguing that Russia represents a primordial, elemental, and "Asiatic" force that Europe has always feared and misunderstood. The poem is both a warning to Europe not to interfere in the Russian Revolution and a declaration of Russia's unique, non-European identity. It taps into a long-standing Russian intellectual debate between "Westernizers" and "Slavophiles," positioning Russia as a distinct Eurasian civilization.
2. The "True Origin" of the Russians (Fact-Checking & Modern Science):
   * Clarifying the Question: The exam question seems to conflate Blok's metaphorical use of "Scythians" with a literal ethnic origin. This is a common misconception that the question itself might be prompting the student to correct.
   * Historical Facts:
      * Scythians: They were predominantly an Iranian-speaking confederation of nomadic tribes dominant in the Pontic-Caspian steppe from approximately the 7th century BC to the 3rd century AD. They were largely assimilated or displaced by later migrations, including the Sarmatians, Goths, and Huns.
      * Slavs (the ancestors of Russians): The early Slavs emerged as a distinct linguistic and cultural group in Central/Eastern Europe much later, around the 5th-6th centuries AD. Their homeland is debated but was likely north of the Carpathian Mountains, in regions like present-day Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus—areas that were, centuries earlier, on the periphery of Scythian influence.
   * Genetic & Archaeological Consensus: There is no direct lineal descent of the Russian people from the Scythians. The ethnogenesis of the Russians is primarily from:
      * Early East Slavic tribes (like the Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs, Vyatichs).
      * Assimilation of Finno-Ugric tribes (indigenous populations of the North Russian forests).
      * A significant Scandinavian (Varangian) element among the ruling elite in the early Kyivan Rus' state (9th-11th centuries).
      * Later influences from Turkic, Baltic, and other groups.
Conclusion to Question #2: Alexander Blok's grounds were poetic and ideological, using the Scythian metaphor to express Russia's revolutionary, anti-Western, and Eurasian identity in 1918. Scientifically, the "true origin" of the Russians is not from the Scythians, but primarily from the later East Slavic tribes, with significant Finno-Ugric and Scandinavian components.

The Question:

"These two pictures illustrate the same legend about the origin of the Russian state. What caused furious disputes about the legend? What is the scientific reply to the question disputed?"

Inference from Context:

Since the pictures are not visible but are described as illustrating a legend about the origin of the Russian state, the legend is almost certainly the "Calling of the Varangians" (or the Normanist theory).

* The Legend: As recorded in the Russian Primary Chronicle (12th century), the Slavic and Finnic tribes of the Novgorod region, mired in internecine conflict, invited the Varangian (Scandinavian) chieftain Rurik and his brothers to rule over them in 862. Rurik established himself in Novgorod, founding the Rurikid dynasty, which ruled Kyivan Rus' and later Muscovy/Russia for over 700 years.

Detailed Answer

The Legend: The two pictures illustrate the foundational legend of the Russian state as recorded in the "Tale of Bygone Years" (The Russian Primary Chronicle), compiled in the 12th century. The legend is known as "The Calling of the Varangians" or the "Invitation to Rurik."

According to the Chronicle, in the year 862, the various Slavic (Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs) and Finno-Ugric (Chud, Ves, etc.) tribes in the region of Novgorod, tired of internal conflict and lacking order, decided to seek a ruler from abroad. They are quoted as saying, "Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us." They invited the Varangian (Scandinavian) chieftain Rurik and his brothers, Sineus and Truvor. Rurik settled in Novgorod (or Ladoga), founding the Rurikid Dynasty, which ruled Kievan Rus' and its successor states (including Muscovy and early Tsardom of Russia) until 1598.

1. What Caused the Furious Disputes About the Legend?

The disputes form the core of the "Normanist Question" (Normanist vs. Anti-Normanist Debate), which has been one of the most heated and politicized debates in Russian historiography for nearly 300 years. The fury stems from its implications for Russian national identity, origins, and political ideology.

* The Normanist Position (Origins in 18th Century German Historians): This view accepts the basic validity of the chronicle's account. It argues that the Scandinavians (Vikings/Varangians) were the decisive, organizing force in the creation of the first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus'. They point to:
   * The name "Rus" itself, which they derive from the Old Norse term "róðr" (a crew of oarsmen) or from "Ruotsi," the Finnish name for Sweden.
   * Archaeological evidence of significant Scandinavian presence in key trade centers like Staraya Ladoga, Novgorod, and Gnezdovo (near Smolensk) in the 9th-10th centuries.
   * The names of the first Rus' princes and ambassadors in Byzantine treaties, which are overwhelmingly Norse (e.g., Oleg = Helgi, Olga = Helga, Igor = Ingvar).
   * The testimony of contemporary foreign sources (Byzantine, Arab) that distinguish the "Rus" as a group separate from the Slavs.
* The Anti-Normanist Position (A Reaction with Nationalist & Political Dimensions): This view rejects the Chronicle's account as a later fabrication or misinterpretation. It argues that the Slavic state was an entirely indigenous development, and the Varangian role was minimal, mercenary, or mythical. The "furious" nature of the dispute arises because:
   * National Pride: The idea that the Russian state was founded by "foreigners" (Germans/Scandinavians) was seen as an insult to national dignity, especially from the 19th century onward as Romantic nationalism grew.
   * Soviet Ideology: Under Stalin, the Normanist theory was officially condemned as "bourgeois falsification" that denied the Slavic peoples' capacity for independent state formation—a key tenet of Marxist historical materialism. Anti-Normanism became state doctrine, and archaeologists/historians who argued for a significant Norse role faced severe persecution.
   * Modern Politics: The debate continues to resonate, with some modern Russian nationalists and "patriotic" historians strongly promoting Anti-Normanist views, seeing the Normanist theory as a Western plot to diminish Russia's historical stature.

In essence, the dispute is furious because it is not just an academic quarrel about archaeology, but a battle over the founding myth of the Russian nation: Was it created from within by the Slavic people, or catalyzed from without by Viking outsiders?

2. What is the Scientific Reply to the Question Disputed?

Modern scholarship, based on decades of interdisciplinary research (archaeology, linguistics, numismatics, comparative chronicle study), has moved beyond the rigid "either/or" dichotomy to a nuanced synthetic consensus. The scientific reply deconstructs the legend and provides a complex, evidence-based picture.

1. The Legend as Foundational Myth: Scholars agree the Chronicle story is a mythologized, later construction (written 300 years after the events) designed to:

* Give the ruling Rurikid dynasty a legitimate and prestigious foreign origin.
* Explain the name "Rus."
* Portray the founding of the state as a peaceful, legal contract, not a conquest.

2. The Consensus on Historical Reality:

* Indigenous Development: The region was not empty. Complex tribal societies of Slavs, Balts, and Finno-Ugric peoples existed, with their own social stratification, trade, and proto-urban centers (like the gorodishche near future Novgorod).
* The Crucial Role of Trade: The Volkhov-Dnieper river system ("The Route from the Varangians to the Greeks") was the economic engine. Control of this trade in furs, slaves, silver, and luxury goods generated the wealth and inter-tribal connections necessary for state formation.
* The Varangians as Catalyst and Elite: Here is the key synthesis: Scandinavian Vikings (Varangians) were not the "creators" of the Slavic people or their culture, but they became the dominant military-commercial elite that unified the pre-existing tribal structures under a new political framework. They were the armed traders and warriors who mastered the long-distance routes, established key fortified trading posts (emporia), and eventually took political control of them.
* The "Invitation" Trope: The concept of "inviting a ruler" is a common medieval literary trope to legitimize power. In reality, the process likely involved a combination of trade, mercenary service, conflict, and gradual assumption of power by a successful Varangian warlord (like the historical Rurik) and his retinue (druzhina).
* Rapid Assimilation: Critically, the Scandinavian elite was small. Within a generation or two, they had completely assimilated into the local Slavic majority, adopting their language, customs, and identity. By the time of Vladimir the Great (late 10th century), the rulers were culturally Slavic Orthodox princes, not Norse pagans.

Final Scientific Reply: The furious dispute is based on a false dichotomy. The modern scientific view holds that the origin of the Russian state was a complex process of internal socio-economic development among the Eastern Slavs, which was critically accelerated, unified, and politically led by a Scandinavian warrior-trading elite. The state of Kievan Rus' was born from the synergy between the Slavic-Finnic substrate and the Varangian superstrate. The legend of Rurik's calling preserves a kernel of truth about the foreign origin of its first dynasty, but not about the origin of the Russian people themselves.

Of course. Based on the provided screenshot, here are detailed explanations and answers for Questions 4 and 5. The facts have been cross-referenced with established historical scholarship.

The Image & The Scene:

The medieval-style illustration depicts Princess Olga of Kiev (c. 920–969), the ruler of Kievan Rus'. The specific scene illustrated is a famous episode from the Primary Chronicle describing her bloody revenge against the Drevlians, the tribe that killed her husband, Prince Igor.
"Why is the woman on the right taking a bath in the presence of the two men?"
Short Answer: She is not taking a bath. It is a trap, and she is having them burned alive.

Detailed Context: After executing several initial acts of revenge on the Drevlians, Olga promised to forgive them and asked for a show of honor. The Drevlians sent their best men to escort her. The chronicle then states: "Olga commanded that a bath be prepared for them, inviting them to wash after their long journey. When the men entered the bathhouse, Olga had it set on fire, and they were all burned to death." The illustration you see captures the moment the Drevlians enter the bathhouse before it is sealed and ignited. The two men are Drevlian ambassadors/nobles, and Olga is overseeing the execution of her elaborate scheme.

1."What differed her as a ruler from the preceding Russian dukes (princes)?"

Princess Olga is a monumental figure who differed from her predecessors (like Oleg, Igor, and her own husband) in two fundamental ways:
1. She was the first major female ruler. She ruled as regent for her young son, Sviatoslav, but exercised power with exceptional skill and authority, securing the state during a vulnerable transition.
2. She was the first Christian ruler of Kievan Rus' and a key civilizing reformer. While her predecessors were pagan warriors focused on conquest and tribute, Olga instituted a systematic, peaceful administration.

Administrative Reforms: She established a system of "pogosts" (administrative and trading centers) and standardized tribute collection, moving away from the chaotic, violent "poludie" (tribute-gathering tours) that got her husband killed.
Religious Significance: Baptized in Constantinople (c. 957), she became the first Christian in the Rus' ruling dynasty. Although she failed to convert her pagan son, her baptism planted the seed for the official Christianization of Rus' under her grandson, Vladimir the Great, in 988. For this, she is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church (Equal-to-the-Apostles).

Summary: She transitioned the ruler's role from a pagan warlord ("knyaz") to a Christian monarch focused on state-building, law, and diplomacy with the Byzantine Empire.

The Image & The City:
The reconstructed red-brick and wood fortress is part of the Kievan Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves) or the general fortifications of Kiev (Kyiv), the capital of modern Ukraine. The question confirms the city is Kiev.
"How did it happen that this city became the 'mother to the Russian cities'..."
The phrase "mother of Russian cities" is a direct translation from the Old East Slavic chronicles ("матерь городам русским"). Kiev earned this title because:
Political Capital: Under Prince Oleg (who moved there from Novgorod around 882), it became the capital of the Rurikid dynasty and the unified state of Kievan Rus'.
Religious & Cultural Center: After the Baptism of Rus' in 988 under Vladimir the Great, Kiev became the seat of the Metropolitan (the head of the Orthodox Church in the region). The magnificent Cathedral of Holy Wisdom (St. Sophia) and the Kiev Pechersk Lavra became centers of liturgy, art, literature, and law (e.g., Russkaya Pravda).
Source of Identity: For centuries, "Rus'" referred primarily to the land around Kiev. The shared Christian faith, dynastic rule, and culture that emanated from Kiev provided the foundational identity for the East Slavic peoples (the ancestors of modern Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians).
"...and how it found itself beyond the Russian borders?"
This refers to Kiev not being part of the modern state of the Russian Federation.

Historical Process:
Decline & Fragmentation (12th-13th centuries): After the death of Vladimir Monomakh, Kievan Rus' fragmented into rival principalities. The political and economic center began shifting north-east to Vladimir-Suzdal and later Moscow.
Mongol Destruction (1240): The Mongol invasion under Batu Khan sacked and devastated Kiev, breaking its power permanently.
Divergent Paths: The historical lands of Rus' developed under different dominions:
The north-east (including Moscow) evolved into the Tsardom of Russia.
The south-west (including Kiev) came under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Modern Borders: Kiev remained a central city for the Ukrainian people. After periods of Cossack autonomy and rule by the Russian Empire, the modern state of Ukraine was formed in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Kiev became the capital of the independent nation of Ukraine, thus placing it "beyond the borders" of the Russian Federation.

Conclusion: Kiev became the "mother of Russian cities" as the first political, religious, and cultural capital of the medieval East Slavic civilization, Kievan Rus'. It now lies outside Russia's borders due to the medieval fragmentation of that civilization, centuries of separate political development under Lithuanian/Polish rule, and the establishment of the modern independent state of Ukraine in the late 20th century.

The Subject:The monuments shown are dedicated to Yaroslav I, known as Yaroslav the Wise (Ярослав Мудрый) (c. 978–1054), Grand Prince of Kiev.

Answer and Explanation:

1. Why the Monuments are in These Specific Cities:
   * Kiev: As the capital, it was the seat of Yaroslav's power. His reign is considered the golden age of Kievan Rus'. The most famous monument to him stands near the Golden Gate, and his greatest architectural achievement, the Cathedral of Saint Sophia, is a UNESCO World Heritage site built under his rule.
   * Novgorod: Before ruling in Kiev, Yaroslav was the Prince of Novgorod. It was from here that he launched the campaign to claim the Kievan throne from his brother. He granted the city a degree of self-governance and a charter of laws, which strengthened its importance. A monument to him is part of the city's historical landscape.
   * Yaroslavl: This city is named after him. According to legend, he founded the city on the Volga River. Monuments to its founder are, therefore, central to the city's identity.
2. His Role in Russian History:Yaroslav the Wise was one of the most important rulers of Kievan Rus'. His role was transformative:
   * Consolidator of the State: He defeated his rivals and reunited the core lands of Rus', ending a period of fratricidal war. His long reign (1019–1054) brought internal stability.
   * Lawgiver: He oversaw the creation and codification of the first written Slavic law code, the "Russkaya Pravda" (Русская Правда, "Justice of Rus'"). This laid the legal foundation for the state for centuries.
   * Builder and Patron of Culture: He transformed Kiev into a major European capital, building the Saint Sophia Cathedral (rivaling Constantinople's Hagia Sophia), the Golden Gate, and monasteries. His court became a center for chronicle-writing, translation of Greek texts, and education.
   * International Statesman: He created a web of dynastic marriages linking Rus' to the royal houses of Europe (France, Hungary, Norway) and the Byzantine Empire, elevating Rus' to a major European power.

Conclusion for Q6: The monuments honor Yaroslav the Wise, the ruler who solidified Kievan Rus' as a stable, law-governed, Christian European power and a major center of culture and architecture.

# 7
The Subject:The text and monuments refer to Vladimir II Monomakh (Владимир Мономах) (1053–1125), Grand Prince of Kiev.

Answer and Explanation:

1. Identifying the Author from the Text:The provided text is a direct excerpt from Monomakh's most famous work, "The Instruction (or Testament) to My Children" (Поучение детям). It is a unique piece of medieval literature—part autobiography, part moral guide, and part political memoir written by a ruling prince for his sons.
   * The text describes a specific historical event: his conflict with Prince Oleg of Chernigov (his cousin) in 1076, where Monomakh chose to cede Chernigov to avoid further bloodshed among Christian Slavs, retreating to the smaller town of Pereslavl. His reflection, "I took pity on the souls of our Christian subjects...", is a hallmark of his writing, emphasizing piety, responsibility, and the avoidance of fratricidal strife.
2. His Role in Russian History:Vladimir Monomakh played a critical role during the beginning of Rus' fragmentation.
   * Last Unifier: He became Grand Prince of Kiev in 1113, not by the usual order of succession, but by popular acclaim of the Kievans to quell a rebellion. He was the last ruler to exercise substantial authority over the increasingly divided and rivalrous principalities of Kievan Rus'.
   * Lawmaker: He added new articles to the "Russkaya Pravda," regulating debts and the status of commoners, showing concern for social order.
   * Military Leader and Diplomat: He is most famous for organizing and leading a series of successful united campaigns against the Cumans (Polovtsians), the nomadic steppe people who constantly raided Rus' lands. His "Instruction" contains vivid accounts of these campaigns. He also used dynastic marriages to secure Rus' borders.
   * Cultural Figure: His "Instruction" is a priceless historical document and literary masterpiece, offering a rare personal voice from the period on rulership, faith, and ethics. It solidified his image as the ideal Christian prince—brave, pious, and wise.
3. The Monuments:The two statues (a bust and a seated figure) are common representations of Monomakh. He is often depicted as a thoughtful, bearded ruler, sometimes holding a cross or a scroll (symbolizing his "Instruction" or the law). Such monuments to him can be found in cities like Moscow (where he is considered a symbolic predecessor of the Muscovite tsars) and Chernigov.
Conclusion: The person is Vladimir Monomakh. His role was that of the last effective ruler of a united Kievan Rus', a famed military leader against the steppe nomads, a lawgiver, and the author of a seminal literary work that defined the ideals of princely rule in Russian culture.

# 8

The Region and the City:

* Region: The region indicated on the map is the North-East of Kievan Rus', specifically the interfluve of the Oka and Volga rivers. This area was the core of the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality.
* The City: The new city to which the center of power moved was Vladimir-on-Klyazma (Vladimir). While founded earlier, it became the political capital in the 12th century under Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky.

Explanation of the Shift in Power and Vladimir's Rise:

The shift of the political center from Kiev to Vladimir in the 12th century was caused by a combination of Kiev's decline and the North-East's strategic advantages.

1. Decline of Kiev (The "Push" Factors):

* Fragmentation & Dynastic Strife: The Kievan Rus' state fragmented into competing principalities after the reign of Vladimir Monomakh. Kiev was constantly fought over by rival branches of the Rurikid dynasty, weakening it through endless princely wars.
* Economic Decline: The Byzantine Empire's decline and the shifting of major Eurasian trade routes (like the Silk Road) away from the Dnieper River undermined Kiev's economic foundation.
* Nomadic Pressure: Constant raids by the Cumans (Polovtsians) on the southern steppe frontiers made the Kiev region increasingly dangerous and unstable, disrupting agriculture and trade.

2. Rise of Vladimir-Suzdal (The "Pull" Factors):

* Strategic Security: The North-East was protected by dense forests ("Zalessky Krai" - "Land beyond the forests"), which acted as a natural buffer against nomadic cavalry raids from the steppe.
* Economic Potential: It featured vast expanses of fertile land ("Opolye"), attracting settlers from the war-torn south. It had abundant resources (timber, furs) and controlled the headwaters of the Volga River trade route.
* Strong, Centralized Rule: Princes like Yuri Dolgoruky and especially his son Andrei Bogolyubsky pursued a policy of strengthening their personal, autocratic power, breaking the tradition of seniority and boyar (noble) councils that hampered Kiev. Andrei explicitly spurned Kiev, sacking it in 1169 and taking the title of Grand Prince to his own capital, Vladimir.
* Symbolic Legitimacy: To legitimize Vladimir as the new capital, Andrei and his successors embarked on a monumental building program. They constructed magnificent white-stone cathedrals (e.g., the Dormition Cathedral) and Golden Gates, rivaling and intended to surpass Kiev's splendor. They also promoted the veneration of a new national icon, the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God.

Conclusion for Q8: The center of power moved from Kiev to Vladimir in the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality because the North-East offered security, economic potential, and the opportunity for its princes to build a new, more centralized state, free from the internecine strife and external vulnerabilities that plagued Kiev.

# 9

The Two External Dangers of the Early 13th Century:

In the early 13th century, the Russian principalities faced a catastrophic existential threat from the East and a severe ideological-military threat from the North-West.

1. The Mongol Invasion (The Tatar-Mongol Yoke):
   * Who: The unified Mongol Empire under Batu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan.
   * When: The main invasion of the Rus' principalities occurred from 1237 to 1240.
   * Nature of the Danger: This was a war of conquest and subjugation. The Mongols employed total warfare, systematically destroying cities (like Ryazan, Vladimir, and Kiev), massacring populations, and dismantling existing political structures. Their goal was to make the Russian princes tributary vassals.
2. The Northern Crusades (Swedish and German Knights):
   * Who: Swedish forces and the German Teutonic Order and Order of the Sword Brothers (later merged as the Livonian Order).
   * When: A sustained campaign throughout the 13th century, with critical battles in the 1240s.
   * Nature of the Danger: This was a religious-political expansion. The Swedish and German orders, under the banner of the Papacy's Northern Crusades, sought to conquer and convert the Orthodox and pagan lands of Novgorod and Pskov. The danger was not just territorial loss but the enforced conversion of the population from Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism, threatening the core of Russian cultural identity.

How Russia Dealt with Them:

The response to these twin threats diverged dramatically, setting a historical course for centuries.

1. Response to the Mongols: Pragmatic Submission and Survival.
   * Military Resistance & Defeat: Initial resistance by individual principalities (like Vladimir) was heroic but futile. The Russian armies were defeated in detail due to a lack of unity and the Mongols' superior military tactics.
   * Acceptance of Vassalage: After the destruction, the surviving Russian princes, beginning with Yaroslav II of Vladimir in 1243, were forced to travel to the Mongol capital Sarai to receive a patent for rule ("yarlyk"). This meant acknowledging the Khan of the Golden Horde as their sovereign, paying heavy tribute (including a tax on individuals), and supplying troops.
   * Result: This established the "Tatar Yoke," a period of over 200 years of Mongol suzerainty. The Russian principalities retained their internal order and Orthodox faith but lost their sovereignty and were bled dry by tribute. This subjugation, while humiliating, allowed Russian statehood and culture to survive.
2. Response to the Western Crusaders: Military Defense and Symbolic Victory.
   * Unified Military Action: The Republic of Novgorod, which was largely spared by the Mongols due to its northern swampy lands, took the lead. It called upon its prince, Alexander Yaroslavich.
   * Alexander Nevsky's Campaigns: Prince Alexander decisively defeated the two invading forces:
      * Battle of the Neva (1240): He defeated a Swedish army, earning the epithet "Nevsky" ("of the Neva").
      * Battle on the Ice (Lake Peipus, 1242): He famously defeated the heavily armored knights of the Teutonic Order on the frozen lake, halting their eastward advance.
   * Result & Strategy: These victories stopped the Catholic German and Swedish expansion into Russian lands. Alexander Nevsky chose a policy of peaceful submission to the Mongols (seeing them as less of a threat to Russian identity, as they did not interfere with the Orthodox Church) in order to focus all resources on defending the western frontier. This policy was endorsed by the Orthodox Church and became foundational for future Muscovite strategy.

Conclusion for Q9: Russia faced annihilation from the Mongol Empire and conquest/conversion from the Western Crusaders. It dealt with the Mongols through pragmatic submission and vassalage to ensure survival, and with the Western threat through decisive military resistance led by Alexander Nevsky. This dual response preserved Orthodoxy and the Russian principalities, albeit under the long and oppressive Mongol Yoke.

Here are detailed, fact-checked answers for Questions 10 and 11, based on the provided descriptions.

# 10

The Name of the Russian Duke:

The duke depicted in both pictures is Alexander Yaroslavich, known as Alexander Nevsky (Александр Невский) (c. 1221–1263), Prince of Novgorod, Grand Prince of Kiev and Vladimir.

Explanation of the Pictures' Plots:

1. Left Picture (The Warrior on Horseback): This depicts Alexander Nevsky as a military commander and saint. The scene almost certainly represents his most famous victory: the Battle on the Ice (Ледовое побоище) on Lake Peipus in 1242, where he decisively defeated the crusading knights of the Teutonic Order. Alternatively, it could symbolize his earlier victory over the Swedes at the Battle of the Neva (1240), from which he earned the epithet "Nevsky" ("of the Neva"). The imagery emphasizes his role as the defender of the Russian lands from Western invaders.
2. Right Picture (The Ruler on the Throne): This depicts Alexander Nevsky as a statesman and loyal vassal. The scene likely shows him paying homage to or receiving a yarlyk (a patent to rule) from a Mongol Khan of the Golden Horde. After the Mongol conquest, Russian princes had to travel to the Horde's capital, Sarai, to pledge allegiance and be confirmed in their principalities. This image illustrates the other, more controversial pillar of Alexander's policy: pragmatic submission to the Mongol Empire to secure peace for his people and his own political authority.

Why was he advertised by Soviet propaganda in the late 1930s?

Soviet propaganda under Joseph Stalin resurrected and radically reshaped Alexander Nevsky's image in 1938 for specific, urgent political reasons tied to the pre-WWII climate:

1. Patriotic Mobilization: With the rising threat of Nazi Germany, Stalin needed a national Russian hero to rally the people, bypassing Communist internationalist ideology. Alexander Nevsky, as a legendary defender of the Motherland against foreign invaders, was perfect.
2. Anti-German Symbolism: The 1938 Sergei Eisenstein film Alexander Nevsky, with its iconic score by Prokofiev, was the centerpiece of this campaign. The film graphically depicted the Teutonic Knights as ruthless, fanatical invaders, creating a direct and powerful historical parallel to the contemporary Nazi threat. The film's famous quote, "Whoever comes to us with a sword, shall die by the sword," was a clear message to Germany.
3. Strategic Message: The propaganda highlighted only one side of his legacy—the defiant resistance to the West. It completely omitted his subservience to the Mongols. The message was clear: Russia must unite and fiercely resist the invasion from the West (Germany), while the government could pursue pragmatic diplomacy with the East (the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact of 1941 echoed this). His canonization by the Orthodox Church was downplayed, secularizing him into a purely national hero.

In summary: The pictures show Alexander Nevsky as both the defender against the West and the pragmatic vassal of the East. Soviet propaganda in the late 1930s exalted the first role to forge a nationalist, anti-German rallying point on the eve of World War II.

The City Marked by the Red Dot:

Based on the map's context ("Principality of Moscow" is labeled) and the historical question, the red dot almost certainly marks Moscow (Москва).

1. Its Name in the Early 13th Century:

In the early 13th century (specifically, at the time of the first written mention and before the Mongol invasion), it was a small fortified town on the Moskva River called Moscow. Its first mention in a chronicle is dated to 1147, when Prince Yuri Dolgoruky of Vladimir-Suzdal is said to have feasted there. There was no other name; it was simply the settlement of Moscow.

2. How it Became the Most Important Russian City by the End of the 13th Century:

Moscow's rise from a minor provincial outpost to the preeminent Russian city by 1300 was dramatic and resulted from a combination of shrewd politics, geography, and Mongol policy.

* Strategic Geography: Moscow was excellently located:
   * At the crossroads of important river trade routes (Moskva River connected the Volga and Oka basins).
   * In the relatively forested center of the Vladimir-Suzdal lands, offering protection from Mongol raids compared to more exposed cities like Vladimir or Kiev.
   * This attracted merchants, artisans, and peasants seeking safety, boosting its population and wealth.
* Shrewd, Long-Reigning Princes: The early princes of Moscow were ambitious and politically astute.
   * Daniel (1261-1303), the founder of the Moscow princely line and youngest son of Alexander Nevsky, is credited with initiating Moscow's expansion, seizing the key town of Kolomna.
   * The princes played the role of loyal, dependable servants to the Mongol Khans of the Golden Horde. They meticulously collected and delivered tribute, often using Mongol authority to undermine rival princes.
* The Key Factor: Mongol Patronage: This was the most critical element. The Mongols (Golden Horde) needed a reliable local ruler to act as their chief tax collector and enforcer among the Russian princes. The princes of Moscow proved ruthlessly efficient at this.
   * In 1328, Prince Ivan I (Ivan Kalita, "Moneybags") helped the Mongols crush a rebellion in Tver, Moscow's main rival. As a reward, the Mongol Khan granted him the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir and the exclusive right to collect tribute for the Horde from all Russian lands.
   * This made Moscow the de facto administrative and financial capital of Rus'. Ivan Kalita used the vast wealth from collected tribute to buy lands, loan money to other princes, and fortify Moscow with the first stone Kremlin (1339). He also persuaded the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Metropolitan, to move his seat from Vladimir to Moscow (c. 1326), making it the religious capital as well.

Conclusion for Q11: The city is Moscow. From a minor fort mentioned in 1147, it rose to supremacy by 1300 and solidified its status by 1340 due to its strategic location, the cunning and loyal service of its princes to the Mongol overlords, and the resulting roles as the primary tax collector for the Horde and, subsequently, the religious and political center of the Russian lands. Its rise was fundamentally tied to its subservient but exploitative relationship with the Mongol Empire.
